46277,0,状元楼饭店第一次去，因为地理位置优越：在宁波市和义大道高、大、上，里面装修中式，菜是地道的宁波菜，口味纯正，醉泥螺特棒，吃到了小时候的味道，因为去了晚了，在大堂等了一会儿，期间有茶水喝、服务员还与你聊天，到了就餐时生意太好，服务员都是小跑状，服务态度绝对不提速，样样都服务到位，点酒水还耐心的与我们解释，就这样绝对要夸一夸，,"Zhuangyuanlou Hotel went for the first time, because of the geographical location: in Ningbo City and Yi Avenue high, big, on, inside the decoration of Chinese, the dish is authentic Ningbo cuisine, the taste is pure, drunk mud snail is particularly good, eat the taste of childhood, because I went late, waited in the lobby for a while, during which there is tea to drink, the waiter also chats with you, to the dining business is too good, the waiter is trotting, the service attitude is absolutely not speedy, everything is in place, the drink is also patiently explained to us, so it is absolutely necessary to boast,"
46277,1,特别是彭新星、洪继华（看服务牌才知道名字）也给我们宁波市形象增色，状元楼是宁波的一扇窗口，服务员的素质更体现我们宁波人的精神面貌。,"In particular, Peng Xinxing and Hong Jihua (only know the name by looking at the service card) also add color to our image of Ningbo, the champion building is a window in Ningbo, and the quality of the waiter reflects the spiritual outlook of our Ningbo"

23691,0,我最爱他们家的猪手，麻辣鸡爪，肉片口磨，道道菜都是家常菜的味道，非常的好吃，是原来的昊烨，和长白街北的强烨饭店，是仔妹店，相同却又不是太相同，弥补了强烨的一个遗憾，就是强烨现在没有宵夜了，老妈家有宵夜，10点以后可以过来。,"I love their pork knuckles, spicy chicken feet, meat slices and mouth grinding, the dishes are all home-cooked taste, very delicious, it is the original Haoye, and the Qiangye restaurant in the north of Changbai Street, it is a sister shop, the same but not too the same, to make up for one of Qiangye's regrets, that is, Qiangye has no supper now, and there is a supper at my mother's house, and you can come over after 10 o'clock."

23660,0,我是比较喜欢荣新馆的，因为材料新鲜，服务又好，价格适中，但是老公每次吃都会拉肚子，特神奇，我喜欢鳌虾，感觉比牡丹虾好吃，但是我们这种小胃口，一人四个也就饱了。,"I prefer Rongxinguan, because the materials are fresh, the service is good, and the price is moderate, but my husband will have diarrhea every time he eats, which is amazing, I like crayfish, and I feel better than peony shrimp, but we have a small appetite, and one person is full of four."
23660,1,对于不吃鱼的人来说，吃日料真的比较亏，只能吃螃蟹，海胆和海螺等带壳海鲜。,"For people who don't eat fish, it's really a loss to eat Japanese food, and they can only eat shell seafood such as crabs, sea urchins, and conchs."
23660,2,里面服务员一直很热情，会叫我们多点些，可能每次来，给服务员感觉都是我们吃的太少了，但是感觉这里一直是海鲜食材新鲜，但是熟物的味道，我感觉一般，没有那么惊艳。,"The waiter inside has been very enthusiastic, will ask us to order more, maybe every time I come, to the waiter feels that we eat too little, but I feel that the seafood here has always been fresh, but the taste of cooked food, I feel average, not so"
23660,3,给予四星，是因为老公会拉肚子，上次我弟弟也拉肚子，貌似女生都好好的，男生就难说了！,"amazing. I gave four stars because my husband had diarrhea, and my brother also had diarrhea last time, and it seems that girls are fine, but boys are hard to say!"

379,1,满满一大锅，里面有螃蟹，大虾，年糕，鸡爪，螃蟹肉很多，真的是肉蟹，鸡爪很好吃，做的软糯的，非常不错，里面还有花生腐竹，味道都不错，服务也很到位，开业第一天最后吃完的，服务员还送了西瓜，很贴心，还会再来的，推荐哦，大家都快点来吃吧，非常划算的,"Full of a big pot, there are crabs, prawns, rice cakes, chicken feet, a lot of crab meat, it is really meat crabs, chicken feet are delicious, soft and glutinous, very good, there are peanuts and bean curd in it, the taste is good, the service is also in place, the first day of the opening of the last to eat, the waiter also sent watermelon, very intimate, will come again, recommended Oh, everyone hurry up to eat, very cost-effective"
13811,0,喜欢KOI好多年了，但是看着它的价格在一路飙涨，真心是有点越来越爱不起来了呢。,"I've loved KOI for many years, but seeing its price soaring, I'm really getting a little bit out of it."
13811,1,不过还好有大众点评的闪惠，每周四半价，太便宜啦~棒棒的~~\\n还是一如既往点了最爱的蒟蒻，其实也不是真的蒟蒻啦，就是椰果，但是我就是好喜欢呢。,"But fortunately, there are flash discounts from public reviews, half price every Thursday, it's too cheap~ Awesome~~\\n I still ordered my favorite konjac as always, in fact, it's not really konjac, it's coconut fruit, but I just like it."
13811,2,而且一定是要微糖，常温，这样才是最好的味道。,"And it must be slightly sugary, room temperature, so that it tastes best."
13811,3,大杯22，中杯17.\\n朋友爱吃仙草，所以给他点了仙草蜜，满满一大杯的仙草，也是不错吃的呢。,"Large cup 22, medium cup 17.\\nFriends love to eat fairy grass, so I ordered him fairy grass honey, a large cup full of fairy grass, which is also delicious."

13894,0,嗯，第三次来了，西米糕没有了，遗憾；,"Well, the third time it came, the sago cake was gone, a pity;"
13894,1,中午来的时候还是人多要等，估计和工作日有关，上次工作日晚上来的，就没等什么；,"When I came at noon, there were still a lot of people to wait, and it was estimated that it was related to the working day, and I didn't wait for anything when I came up late on the last working day;"
13894,2,所以大家注意时间去；,So everyone pay attention to the time to go;
13894,3,冬阴功汤比上次味道略淡，但是老板是说怕有些客人不喜欢重口，但是我建议还是按照风味来，毕竟可以在点菜的时候解说下；,"Tom Yum soup is slightly lighter than last time, but the boss said that he was afraid that some guests would not like heavy bites, but I suggest that it should be according to the flavor, after all, you can explain it when ordering;"
13894,4,就是上菜要一桌一桌来上……,"That is, the food should be served table by table......"
13894,5,猪颈肉刚觉比上次好吃，柠檬鱼也是很新鲜，都吃完了，推荐。,"The pork neck meat is better than last time, and the lemon fish is also very fresh, and it is recommended to eat it."
13894,6,\\n可能店不是很大，服务员也不多，今天就一个妹子，有时候喊不过来，等待一长就添茶水比较慢。,"\\nMaybe the store is not very big, and there are not many waiters, just a girl today, sometimes you can't shout, and it's slower to wait for a long time to add"
13894,7,\\n然后就是现在有闪单优惠，还是划算。,"tea. \\nAnd then there is now a flash order discount, which is still a good deal."
27690,0,本来没打算吃火锅的，这家味道实在太香....,"I didn't plan to eat hot pot, but this one tastes so fragrant...."
27690,1,店里有实付100送50抵价券的活动，还好优惠买单叠加，又送饮料菜品啥的，两个人吃了160超划算！,"There is an activity in the store that pays 100 and gets 50 coupons, but fortunately, the discount is superimposed, and the drinks and dishes are sent, and the two people eat 160 super cost-effective!"
27690,2,\\n菜品讲道理一般，招牌的虾球丸子还可以，其他标准水平，比较细节的是娃娃菜切的很细，这在火锅里比较少见，但能在蔬菜上下功夫，还是蛮用心的orz\\n环境不错，交通方便，服务员热情又不让人尴尬，不插话不打断客人，叫的时候随时能过来\\n也有差评项，水果切的有味道...,"\\nThe dishes are reasonable, the signature shrimp ball balls are OK, other standard levels, the more detailed is that the baby cabbage is cut very finely, which is relatively rare in the hot pot, but it can work vegetables, or quite attentive orz\\n The environment is good, the transportation is convenient, the waiter is enthusiastic and not embarrassing, do not interrupt the guests, you can come over at any time when you call\\nThere are also bad reviews, and the fruit is cut with"
27690,3,刀没洗干净吧,taste... The knife hasn't been cleaned
39309,0,这店在仓边路公车站附近 老字号,"This restaurant is located near the bus stop on Cangbian Road, and it is a small restaurant with an affordable price."

39309,9,。\\n\\n水煮牛肉,"Boiled lettuce, but it doesn't taste"
39309,10,牛肉挺嫩滑的 配菜是豆芽。叉烧肥牛米粉 分量可以 米粉爽口。水煮生菜 不过不失 没什么味道。以前吃过这里的粥 听说是招牌 但是粥底真的不怎么 不够绵 再来也不会吃粥。,"good. I've eaten porridge here before, and I've heard that it's a signboard, but the bottom of the porridge is really not very good, not enough to be soft, and I won't eat porridge again."
8664,0,"其实本来是要去吃郑爽爽咖喱羊排的,可是,没想到杀过去的时候店门竟然没开,明明那时候已经12点了呀Ծ‸Ծ难道是周日店休么。。。","Actually, I was going to eat Zheng Shuangshuang's curry lamb chops, but, I didn't expect the store to be open when I killed it, and it was already 12 o'clock at that time."
8664,1,"好讨厌的感觉啊啊啊,尤其是刚刚交完5块钱停车费的人表示心好塞啊啊啊,鉴于已经停了车,而且这一代平时也不太会专程来,那就干脆在附近觅个食吧。","It's a nasty feeling, especially the person who just paid the 5 yuan parking fee said that he was so congested, in view of the fact that the car has been parked, and this generation usually doesn't usually make a special trip, so just look for food nearby."
8664,2,"打开点评的APP一搜,忽然发现旁边有美邻扁食,印象之前在微博上也看到过好几次,貌似是老字号了,那就随遇而安走一个呗。","Open the APP of the review and search, and suddenly found that there is a beautiful neighbor next to it, and I have seen it several times on Weibo before, and it seems to be a time-honored brand, so let's go with it."
8664,3,"\\n店面不大,装修也很简单,不过人气很旺的样子,一直有客人进进出出,翻桌率很高。","\\nThe store is not big, and the decoration is very simple, but it is very popular, and there are always customers coming in and out, and the table turnover rate is very high."
8664,4,"店里东西不算很丰富,简单几样扁食拌面猪肝汤脱骨肉汤,以及猪肝跟脱骨肉单拌跟加面。","The things in the store are not very rich, just a few kinds of flat food mixed noodles, pork liver soup, boneless broth, and pork liver and boneless meat mixed with noodles."
8664,5,"要了扁食拌面以及一份猪肝汤面,出菜速度那叫一个快,咻咻的。","I asked for flat noodles and a pork liver soup noodle, and the speed of the dish was called a fast, sigh."
8664,6,"卖相就是非常classic的扁食拌面,分量适中,汤热乎乎的,在这阴冷阴冷的天气真是非常舒服。","It looks like a very classic flat noodles, the portion is moderate, the soup is hot, and it is really comfortable in this cold and cold weather."
8664,7,"汤头甜的出乎意料,正在寻思是不是加了啥调料,忽然听到进门一个老客人点餐说扁食不要加味精,恍然大悟,原来如此,还可以要求不加味精的啊？!不过汤里本身就有冬菜跟葱花,其实即便只是清汤也不会差。","The soup was unexpectedly sweet, and I was thinking about whether I had added any seasoning, and suddenly I heard an old guest ordering food that said that flat food should not be added to MSG, and suddenly realized, I see, you can also ask for no MSG."
8664,8,"扁食很Q弹,不过感觉偏咸,店里也有生的让人打包回家自己煮。","The flat food is very Q-bomb, but it feels salty, and there are raw ones in the store that people can take home and cook by themselves."
8664,9,"出乎意料的是拌面跟猪肝面都很好吃,拌面加了一点点汤所以不会太干,花生酱吃起来真是香!!","Surprisingly, the noodles and pork liver noodles are delicious, the noodles are added with a little soup so they are not too dry, and the peanut butter tastes really delicious!!"

35904,0,被朋友意外拉来重庆玩，简直是一场说走就走的旅行。,Being accidentally pulled to Chongqing by a friend to play is simply a trip that is just about to go.
35904,1,去重庆的前一天还在纠结到底是重庆还是成都，然而第二天就妥妥的买了重庆的票。,"The day before I went to Chongqing, I was still struggling with whether it was Chongqing or Chengdu, but the next day I bought a ticket for Chongqing."
35904,2,其实两个城市对我而言都是满意的，因为火锅，因为麻辣。,"In fact, both cities are satisfactory to me, because of the hot pot, because of the spicy."
35904,3,\\n\\n第一天到了已经中午11点，人困马乏，所以打算休息一会下午去解放碑逛吃逛吃。,"\\n\\nIt was already 11 o'clock at noon on the first day, and people were sleepy and tired, so I planned to rest for a while and go to the Liberation Monument to eat and eat in the afternoon."
35904,4,好吃街因为离解放碑超近所以也成为大家慕名而来的地方，这条小吃街虽然短，但是食物真的是超级好吃啊。,"Because it is very close to the Liberation Monument, the food street has also become a place where everyone comes to visit, although this snack street is short, but the food is really super delicious."
35904,5,好又来酸辣粉一直是朋友的强烈推荐，也是各个美食吃货家们必需来一碗的小吃，我当然也不例外。,"Haoyoulai hot and sour noodles have always been highly recommended by friends, and they are also a must-have snack for foodies of all kinds of foodies, and I am certainly no exception."
35904,6,\\n\\n一开始没有找对地方，导航真的是太不给力，带着我们直绕圈，在王府井往前也有一家好又来，但是并没有酸辣粉，只有绿色的凉皮还有烤鱿鱼之类的，这家我们也吃了，主要是一开始你找到。,"\\n\\n didn't find the right place at the beginning, the navigation was really too weak, with us straight around the circle, there was also a good one in front of Wangfujing, but there was no hot and sour powder, only green cold skin and grilled squid and the like, this we also ate, mainly at the beginning you found."
35904,7,后来去了一家买冰水喝，问了老板好吃街的具体地点，才发现原来这么近，呵呵呵，简直了。,"Later, I went to a store to buy ice water to drink, and asked the boss the specific location of the delicious street, only to find that it was so close, hehehe, it's simple."
35904,8,一眼就看到了排了好多人的好又来酸辣粉，好多人都端着碗在小小的店铺门口吃的超级爽。,"At a glance, I saw that there were a lot of people lined up and there were hot and sour noodles, and many people were eating super cool at the door of the small store with bowls."
35904,9,我们虽然刚才也吃了不少，但还是又来了一碗酸辣粉还有刨冰吧。,"Although we ate a lot just now, we still had another bowl of hot and sour noodles and shaved ice."
35904,10,酸辣粉上面是杂酱，味道非常过瘾麻辣，吃得好嗨，爱吃辣的人绝对不能错过，然后配着挫冰吃，简直爽爆了好吗！,"The hot and sour noodles are topped with mixed sauce, the taste is very enjoyable and spicy, it is so good to eat, people who love spicy food must not miss it, and then eat it with frustrated ice, it is simply refreshing!"
35904,11,然后呢，价钱也不贵，6块钱一碗，较于其他地方，重庆来说物价相对来说还是便宜的，毕竟放假便宜吧，这样食物里的存在成本自然也低。,"Then, the price is not expensive, 6 yuan a bowl, compared to other places, the price of Chongqing is relatively cheap, after all, the holiday is cheap, so the cost of food is naturally"
35904,12,刨冰还是挫冰也是6块，但是真的很好吃啊。,"low. There are 6 pieces of shaved ice or frustrated ice, but it's really delicious."
15584,0,在来福士逛，过了饭点不想去吃正餐就在地下一层随便逛逛，出了室内区域就看到了这家店，搜了下点评感觉还可以就进去了，过了饭点店里的人不算很多，点了个套餐，米线有点过桥米线的感觉生的食材现场放锅里，点了番茄的底，米线还挺入味的，汤也好喝，作为一个对汤没有抵抗力的人依旧是喝光汤的节奏，豆浆是用粉泡的基本口味跟kfc的豆浆持平，,"Shopping in Raffles, after the meal, I don't want to eat the main meal on the basement floor casually, out of the indoor area I saw this store, searched for reviews and felt that I could go in, after the meal, there are not many people in the shop, I ordered a set meal, the rice noodles are a little over the bridge rice noodles feel raw ingredients are put in the pot on the spot, the bottom of the tomato is ordered, the rice noodles are still quite flavorful, the soup is also delicious, as a person who has no resistance to the soup is still the rhythm of drinking the soup, the soybean milk is soaked in powder The basic taste is the same as the soybean milk of KFC,"
15584,1,肉串味道也蛮好的，是比较满意的简餐，车子停在来福士现在凭吃饭的小票消费满额可以去服务台领5块的停车券，之前忘了买单的时候想来店家也帮忙重新打印单子了服务态度还挺好的,"The meat skewers taste quite good, it is a simple meal that is more satisfying, the car is parked in Raffles, and now you can go to the service desk to get a parking coupon of 5 yuan with a meal ticket full consumption, and you forgot to pay when you want to come to the store to help reprint the list, and the service attitude is very good"
491,0,Baker&Spice是上海Wagas（沃歌斯，后文为方便起见均用该名称代指Baker&Spice）旗下的餐厅。,Baker &Spice is a restaurant owned by Wagas in Shanghai.
491,1,沃歌斯青岛首家餐厅位于万象城LG层中门外侧，意外不是很起眼的位置，在猪头肉印象里这家餐厅也相对比较低调，一直不温不火。,"The first restaurant in Qingdao is located outside the middle gate of the LG floor of the MixC, which is unexpectedly not very inconspicuous, and this restaurant is relatively low-key in the impression of pork head meat, and has been tepid."
491,2,正如其名，该餐厅的主营的糕点和意面披萨等简餐都有非常不错的水准。,"As the name suggests, the restaurant's main menu of pastries, pasta, pizza and other light meals is of a very good standard."
491,3,近期经常来沃歌斯，所以就做一下较深度点评。,"I've been coming to Wagas a lot lately, so I'll make a more in-depth review."
491,4,\\n\\n,"\\n\\n The furnishings of Wagas are simple and bright, with a Nordic style."
491,5,沃歌斯的装修陈设简洁明亮，偏向北欧范儿。而没做吊顶,And the bare ceiling without a suspended ceiling and the hanging incandescent lamp have a hint of industrial style.
491,6,的裸顶和垂下来的白炽灯又带着一丝工业风。高,The high-end literary environment has successfully elevated the restaurant's style.
491,7,端文艺范的环境已经成功拉升了餐厅的格调。\\n,"\\n Ordered two salads at Wagas, one Caesar salad and one chicken mango salad."
491,8,在沃歌斯点过两次沙拉，一次凯撒沙拉一次鸡肉芒果沙拉。虽然猪头肉并不喜,"Although pork head doesn't like lettuce-heavy salads, Wagas salads do taste very good."
491,9,欢吃生菜多的沙拉，不过,Caesar salad is a classic dish.
491,10,沃歌斯的沙拉味道确实非常不错。凯撒沙拉是经典名菜了。,"Wagas's Caesar salad is no chicken by default, and it costs 18 yuan to add chicken."
491,11,沃歌斯的凯撒沙拉默认是不加鸡肉，,The pig's head regretted that it didn't add money and chicken at that time.
491,12,加鸡肉需要加18元。猪头肉就后悔当时没有加钱加鸡肉。简版的凯撒沙,"The short version of Caesar salad consists of quail eggs, minced meat and vegetables, sprinkled with breadcrumb-like crumbs."
491,13,拉是鹌鹑蛋、肉脯碎配蔬菜，上面撒着类似面包糠的碎屑。沃歌斯的沙拉首先胜在食材质量，鹌鹑,"Wagas's salad is first and foremost about the quality of the ingredients, not to mention the quail eggs and lettuce, and the taste of the minced meat is very positive."
491,14,蛋和生菜不说，肉脯碎的味道就很正,"In addition, the dressing of the Caesar salad is very authentic."
491,15,，大有双鱼牌的赶脚。另外凯撒沙拉的的,Chicken and mango salad is the sales champion of the salad category here.
491,16,酱汁也非常地道。鸡肉芒果沙拉,The chicken is grilled at a moderate temperature and the meat is firm.
491,17,是这里沙拉类的销售冠军。鸡肉烤的,"The mango is cut into very large pieces, and it is really refreshing to eat."
491,18,火候适中，肉质紧实。芒果切的非常大块，,There are also a variety of side dishes such as avocados.
491,19,吃到确实很爽。以牛油果为首的各类蔬果配菜也非常丰,The special sweet and sour sauce with cream has a fresh and unique flavor and is very appetizing.
491,20,富。特制的酸甜味酱汁配奶油的味道清新独特，非常开胃。\\n\\n,"\\n\\n I have tasted three kinds of pasta in half and two, each with its own characteristics, and the overall feeling is very good."
491,21,意面半两尝过三款，各有特色，总体感觉都非常不错。细面配三文鱼通过烹制过,Choosing to squeeze a little lemon juice during consumption can neutralize the oiliness and heaviness and add a hint of freshness.
491,22,程中加入少量奶油很好的烘托了三文鱼浓郁的味道。而选择在食用过程中挤一点柠檬汁则可以,"White wine seafood pasta is the top seller in the pasta category, with shrimp, biguan, clams and a dash of dried cherry tomatoes and celery."
491,23,中和油腻感和厚重感，增加一丝清新。白葡萄酒海鲜意面是意面类的销售冠军，辅料是虾仁、比管、花蛤还有一点圣女果干和西芹。这款意面比,"This pasta is less oily than other pastas, but you can clearly taste the aroma of white wine, and the sweetness and sourness of dried cherry tomatoes and the tenderness of celery are well matched by the aroma of white wine."
491,24,其他意面都要少油，相对的却可以明显的尝出白葡萄酒的,"The freshness of the seafood used is also very high, and the shrimp are made from local fresh sea-caught shrimp."
491,25,清香，而圣女果干沉淀的酸甜和西芹的水嫩很好的配合了白葡萄酒的香味。使用的海鲜鲜度,"It is evident that the whole pasta dish does not use seasonings to enhance the freshness, and the freshness comes entirely from the seafood including shrimp."
491,26,也非常高，虾仁出自本地鲜活的海捕虾。可以明显尝得出来整道意,"The basil sauce used in the green sauce chicken pasta has a very pure taste, and the basil sauce alone is amazing."
491,27,面并没有使用提鲜的调味料，鲜度完全来自于以海虾为首,"It is served with cream, and the hollow flour and chicken go well with it."
491,28,的海鲜。绿酱鸡肉意,This pasta dish is highly recommended.
491,29,面使用的罗勒酱味道非常纯正，单是罗勒酱就很赞了。配上奶油口感浓醇爽滑，搭配的空心粉和鸡肉也超,"\\n\\n Wagas also has a few Southeast Asian-style curry rices, and the pork head is one of the Thai spicy beef."
491,30,合拍。这道意面强力推荐。\\n\\n,"This curry is made with beef, pickled seaweed, peppers and cashew nuts."
491,31,沃歌斯还有几款东南亚风的咖喱饭，猪头肉点过其中一款泰式辣味牛肉。这,"The spices of the curry create a spicy flavor that is enjoyable, and the glutamate of the sea vegetables is an excellent garnish."
491,32,款咖喱是由牛肉、泡发海菜、菜椒和腰果烹制的。牛,"The soup of the curry is thick, and the long-grain basmati rice of the side dishes is of good quality."
491,33,肉选用的是类似里脊牛腩的部位，肉质,The experience of the whole dish together is still very good.
491,34,很嫩又有嚼劲。咖喱的香辛料绘制出的鲜辣味道很过瘾，而海菜的谷氨酸做了出色,"\\n\\n Pizza tried two, the seafood pizza and the ham mushroom pizza."
491,35,的点缀。咖喱的汤汁比较浓,Wagas pizzas are all pizza bases.
491,36,稠，配菜的长粒香米质量也很好。配在一起整道菜的体验,"Probably with baking soda in the dough, the pizza base is very fluffy and crispy."
491,37,还是很不错的。\\n\\n,"The pizza has a lot of cheese and tastes good, and it goes well with the special pizza base."
491,38,披萨试过两款，意式海鲜披萨和火腿蘑菇披萨。沃歌斯的披萨都是薄饼底。可能是在面,"The seafood pizza uses the same seafood as the seafood pasta, but it also highlights the umami flavor of seafood such as shrimp."
491,39,团里放了小苏打，披萨的饼底非常蓬松酥脆。披萨的芝士也是超级多,The ham mushroom pizza sets off the meaty aroma of high-quality ham with the unique umami flavor of mushrooms.
491,40,，味道也很正，跟特制的,Both pizzas are highly recommended.
491,41,薄饼底正是绝配。意式海鲜披萨使用的海鲜与海鲜意面相同，也是,\\n\\n The quality of Wagas' desserts is also very good.
491,42,突出了以海虾为首的海鲜带来的鲜味。而火腿蘑菇披,The sauce of the raspberry chocolate tart has a strong sour flavor and is pure raspberry jam.
491,43,萨则以口菇特有的鲜味很好的衬托了优质火腿的肉香。这两款披萨都非常推荐。\\n\\n,"The mango almond cheesecake is also cut into large pieces, and the sauce mixed with cream and cheese is sandwiched in the middle, and the almond cake at the bottom of the cake tastes very good."
491,44,沃歌斯的甜品品质也非常不错。树莓巧克力挞的酱汁酸味很重，是纯正的树莓果酱。芒果杏仁芝士蛋糕的芒,"The texture of the carrot cake is also mellow to the feeling of coarse grain cake or date cake, and it contains carrots and pecans, which is also very good."
491,45,果切得也很大块，中间夹的应该是奶油和芝士混合的酱，饼底的杏仁蛋糕味道很正。胡萝卜蛋糕的酱类似卡仕达酱，但很,"\\n\\n Wagas's light meals and desserts are of a relatively high level, and they are very delicate and tasteful at the same price."
491,46,甜，就像混合了蜂蜜或者炼,"I have not tasted bread, and I do not judge."
491,47,乳，口感非常醇厚。胡萝卜蛋糕的饼底口,"It's not very popular at the moment, so the environment is still very good."
491,48,感也是醇厚到类似粗粮蛋糕,The disadvantage is that there are flying insects in the
491,49,或是枣糕的感觉，里面有胡萝卜和山核桃，也是非常不错。\\n\\n        沃歌斯的简餐和甜品水平都比较高，在同等价位里算是制作非常精致味道比较考究的了。面包没尝过，不妄作评断。目前不是很火爆，所以环境还是很好的。缺点是临街店内会有飞虫。另外猪头肉爆料一下，楼上CGV影院的会员卡在这里除了饮品之外都可享七五折，在万象城性价比还是蛮高的。,"storefrontage. In addition, the pig's head meat broke the news that the membership card of the CGV theater upstairs can enjoy a 75% discount here in addition to drinks, and the cost performance in the MixC is quite high."

47131,2,找。因为是银川最繁华的街，所以不建议自己开车来这里吃饭，停车就是个大难题。坐公交,"It is much more convenient to take the bus, there are many buses, sit on the Guofang Parkson and get off, walk dozens of meters, diagonally opposite the alley."

39185,4,上面一层第一感觉还是有点压抑的感觉，空间不是很高的。,"The first feeling of the upper layer is still a bit depressing, and the space is not very high."
39185,5,\\n就下面一层来说空间感觉还好，环境来说还是挺典型的茶餐厅的摆设，很简单的长沙发式椅子配上玻璃的木质桌子分在了两边，中间圆形的桌子加上和长沙发一样颜色的椅子。,"\\nAs far as the lower floor is concerned, the space feels good, and the environment is still quite typical of the tea restaurant, with very simple couch-style chairs and wooden tables with glass on both sides, and a round table in the middle plus chairs of the same color as the couch."

39185,15,看了看他们家的餐牌，感觉价格来说都还是有点小贵的，也不知道是不是位于解放碑这个位置的原因。,"acceptable. Looking at their menu, I feel that the price is still a little expensive, and I don't know if it is because it is located in the location of the Liberation Monument."
6268,0,他家还是前年左右在一店吃过当时赶脚还是蛮不错的啦，反正夏天必备精神食粮；,"His family still ate it in a store about the year before last, and it was quite good to rush at that time, anyway, it was necessary to eat spiritual food in summer;"

6268,2,他家面条配料其实一般，除了几片牛肉就是一点黄瓜丝和泡菜，然后卤蛋半个，我怎么记得以前是一整个？,"The ingredients of his noodles are actually average, except for a few slices of beef, a little cucumber shreds and kimchi, and then half a braised egg, how do I remember that it used to be a"
6268,3,这种韩式冷面因为太劲道所以需要多次咀嚼否则很难消化掉，确实赶脚添加剂可能多了点，不宜多吃吧，反正就夏天偶尔次次，嘴馋的吃货是戒不了这一口的~,"whole? This kind of Korean-style cold noodles need to be chewed many times because they are too strong, otherwise it is difficult to digest, and it is true that there may be more additives for the feet, so it is not advisable to eat more, anyway, it is occasionally in summer, and gluttonous foodies can't quit this bite~"

14924,7,挺真材实料的，比韩国烤肉送的好吃。,"It's very real, and it's better than the Korean barbecue."
14924,8,二指禅是火腿肠形状的，六块一根，以假乱真。,"The two-finger Zen is in the shape of ham sausage, six pieces and one piece, to confuse the real with the fake."

29583,3,咖色的外表，可爱的摆件加之闪烁的小灯，让人感觉这就是甜点咖啡屋，每每路过这总喜欢停下脚步进去点份蛋糕找个小位置坐会，一种小资的情调。,"The coffee-colored appearance, the cute ornaments and the flashing small lights make people feel that this is the dessert coffee house, and every time I pass by, I always like to stop and go in to order a cake and find a small place to sit down, a kind of petty bourgeois mood."

23578,1,在瑞金路工作的时候老是听同事提，但是没在来吃。,"When I was working on Ruijin Road, I always listened to my colleagues mention it, but I didn't come to eat."
23578,2,直到有一天来吃了！,Until one day I came to eat!
23578,3,肥肠加腰花面简直简直了！,The fat intestine and waist flower noodles are simply simple!
23578,4,现在不在那里上班了，仍然挂念着他们家的三鲜面和肥肠面呢…,"Now that I don't work there, I'm still thinking about their family's three fresh noodles and fat intestine noodles..."
23578,5,环境一般，因为是开在自己家门口的，老板娘特别健谈，会和你介绍他们俩的面怎么用料足，材料都是自己去挑选的，面条也是和别家不一样特别定的，总之去吃了她会特别热情。,"The environment is general, because it is opened at the door of their own house, the proprietress is very talkative, and will introduce to you how the noodles of the two of them are sufficient, the materials are selected by themselves, and the noodles are not different from other"

34602,4,调料是自助的，像我这种不能吃芝麻酱的简直大喜，但是还是想说北京铜锅特制的腐乳芝麻酱其实很棒，不爱吃辣的口味清淡的，推荐就芝麻酱别的调料别加。,"The seasoning is self-service, like me, I can't eat sesame sauce is simply happy, but I still want to say that the special bean curd sesame sauce made by Beijing copper pot is actually great, I don't like to eat spicy and light taste, I recommend don't add other seasonings to sesame sauce."

25188,0,早就想吃了  今天终于去了  还是冒着雨去的  为了吃个饭也是挺拼的  人不多 上菜还挺快  担担面味道还行  但是面条我不知道是不是正宗的感觉没劲儿 小面味道很好 同样的我觉得面条本身不好吃软 没劲儿  红糖糍粑很好吃 好像炸年糕  红油水饺好吃 鲜肉馅的 口水鸡今天半价味道也不错 唯一不满意的是小笼包  不好吃 不建议点  这些东西看起来不贵  但是点点就不少  这些一共花了七十,I've wanted to eat it for a long time I finally went today I still braved the rain to go It's also quite hard to eat There are not many people There are not many people Serving the food is quite fast Dandan noodles taste okay But the noodles I don't know if they are authentic The small noodles taste very good The same I think the noodles themselves are not delicious and soft Boring Brown sugar glutinous rice cakes are delicious Like fried rice cakes Red oil dumplings are delicious Fresh meat stuffing Saliva chicken tastes good at half price today The only dissatisfaction is xiaolongbao It is not delicious It is not recommended to order These things do not look expensive But there are a lot of points These cost a total of seventy
25188,1,关键我俩吃完没觉得饱 量小  而且太油腻  偶尔吃吃可以 没有什么特别惊艳的,"The key is that we didn't feel full after eating, the amount was small and too greasy, and it was okay to eat occasionally, and there was nothing particularly amazing"
12657,0,周日晚上汇京的地下一层，完全没什么人，进这家完全是因为刚好要在虹桥路地铁站附近吃饭，串串是相对比较能激起食欲的一个选项了。,"On Sunday night, there were no people on the basement floor of Huijing, and I entered this house because I happened to be eating near the Hongqiao Road subway station, and skewers were a relatively good option to whet my appetite."
12657,1,\\n\\n店面不大，几个四人座和几个两人座，锅底红油芝麻看起来很不粗，可是串串应该是热水里汆过就直接放里面的，有一半都没有浸没到锅底里，所以吃的时候基本没什么滋味，也就是牛肉是腌过的，还可以，青笋这种切大块的基本就是白煮菜的。,"\\n\\nThe store is not big, a few four-seaters and a few two-seaters, the red oil sesame seeds at the bottom of the pot don't look thick, but the skewers should be boiled in hot water and put directly inside, half of them are not immersed in the bottom of the pot, so there is basically no taste when eating, that is, the beef is marinated, and it is okay, and the green bamboo shoots are basically boiled vegetables."
12657,2,所以理想中的麻辣鲜香，基本也就失望而归了。,"Therefore, the ideal spicy and fresh fragrance is basically"
12657,3,小菜里面的泡菜味道不错，值得推荐一下。,"disappointed. The kimchi inside the side dish tastes good, so it's worth recommending."

43901,1,就是比一般的吐司厚一点的吐司 大份是小份的双倍 暂时只吃了夏威夷火腿厚吐司 芝士好厚 但是做了好久 感觉是个披萨也该烤好了 不过味道还是不错的\\n其实作为一个肉食控 好想试试超级左右腿的 奈何钱包空空 下次试试看 明天厚吐司半价 继续尝试别的口味哈哈哈,"It's a little thicker toast than ordinary toast The large portion is double the small portion For the time being, I only ate Hawaiian ham thick toast The cheese is so thick But I have been doing it for a long time I feel that it is a pizza and it should be baked But the taste is still good \\n In fact, as a meat control I really want to try the super left and right legs But the wallet is empty Try it next time Tomorrow the thick toast is half price Continue to try other flavors hahaha"

45334,4,另外点了一份牛肉大杂烩，里面有白菜，粉条，牛肉，牛肉丸，非常好吃。,"I also ordered a smorgasbord of beef with cabbage, vermicelli, beef, and beef balls, which was very delicious."
45334,5,但感觉有些贵，46元一份，份量不是很多。,"But it feels a little expensive, 46 yuan a serving, not a lot."
45334,6,这个餐厅还放有虾片，感觉比别家的好吃。,"This restaurant also has shrimp chips, which feel better than"
45334,7,\\n        卫生间很干净，尤其让人感觉到温馨的是，卫生间除了放有卫生纸外，盒子里还放有卫生巾，盒子上还写有提示语。,"others. \\n The bathroom is very clean, especially the warmth is that in addition to the toilet paper, there are also sanitary napkins in the box, and there are reminders written on the box."
42722,0,麦当劳和肯德基果然是好基友，有麦麦的地方肯定有肯德基，因为在家附近的原因，所以这家肯德基还蛮常来的，最近新装修了，风格变了下，也很贴心的在特定的座位下安有插座，供顾客手机充电之类的，不过毕竟是在车站附近，装修的再高大上，其实整体环境也是嘈杂的，偶尔还会见一两个人躺在椅子上睡觉。,"McDonald's and KFC are really good friends, there must be KFC where there is McMc, because of the reasons near home, so this KFC is quite frequent, recently renovated, the style has changed, and it is also very intimate to install sockets under specific seats for customers to charge their mobile phones and the like, but after all, it is near the station, no matter how tall the decoration is, in fact, the overall environment is also noisy, and occasionally one or two people will sleep on the chair."
42722,1,现在来肯德基我基本上都是只买蛋挞的，不是夸奖肯德基，它家的蛋挞真的是我吃过众多蛋挞里面味道最好的，不管是不是个人口味偏好，外酥里嫩，每次买的蛋挞都是热热的，咬一口中间的挞心还会流出来，吃的真的是满脸感动，不过蛋挞这种高热量的东西不要天天吃。,"Now when I come to KFC, I basically only buy egg tarts, not to praise KFC, its egg tarts are really the best taste among the many egg tarts I have eaten, whether it is a personal taste preference, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, every time I buy an egg tart is hot, the tart heart in the middle of a bite will flow out, and the food is really full of emotion, but the high-calorie thing like egg tarts should not be eaten every day."
42722,2,偶尔吃吃就好了。,It's good to eat once in a
42722,3,管住嘴管住嘴。,while. Keep your mouth shut.
12366,0,听门口的店员介绍感觉还不错就进来。,"I listened to the clerk at the door, and I felt that it was pretty good, so I came in."
12366,1,结果真是失望透顶。,It turned out to be a real disappointment.
12366,2,套餐里的菜外面的说可以换，进来点之后一个店员先说不确定，然后换了一个说去问问厨房，故等之，回来之后说可以。,"The dishes in the set said that they could be changed, and after coming in, a clerk first said that he was not sure, and then changed one and said to ask the kitchen, so wait, and said that he could after coming back."
12366,3,于是下了单，并格外点了菜品。,So I placed an order and ordered extra dishes.
12366,4,结果又重新来一个店员再次询问，态度很是奇怪。,"As a result, a new clerk asked again, and his attitude was very strange."
12366,5,套餐就算便宜你们不想接待那干嘛要设呢？,"Even if the package is cheap, you don't want to accept it, so why set it up?"
12366,6,而且进门前我们就咨询过是否可以更换菜品的事宜。,"And before we entered the door, we asked if we could change the dishes."
12366,7,店员之间自己不交接好却三番五次地来询问顾客，并且态度很不友好。,"The clerks don't hand over each other but come to ask customers again and again, and the attitude is very unfriendly."
12366,8,再来，我们去的时候不算是饭点，人也不多。,"Again, when we went, it wasn't a meal, and there weren't many people."
12366,9,可是上了三个素菜之后就再也没有菜上来了。。。,"But after serving three vegetarian dishes, there were no more dishes..."
12366,10,是的，是再也没有，连套餐里的饭都没上。,"Yes, yes again, not even the meal in the set meal."
12366,11,于是我们弱弱地催了下，因为你们也看过火锅店被人泼开水的新闻，态度好保命啊。,"So we weakly urged it, because you have also seen the news of the hot pot restaurant being splashed with boiling water, and the attitude is so life-saving."
12366,12,然后过了一会上来的菜。。,"And then after a while, the dishes that came up."
12366,13,我们都震(wu),"We were all shocked, and after a few rounds of confirmation, we were still served the dishes that we said we wanted to change before entering the door. . ."
12366,14,惊（yu)了，经过几轮确认后竟然还是给我们上了进门前就说要更换的菜。。。这，我们非常不好意思地表达后又开始了更漫长的等待，中间忍不住催了下，一个店员说更换的菜品要输入电脑厨房才操作，所以要多等下，于是我们似乎明白之前多次,"This, we were very embarrassed to express and then began to wait longer, in the middle couldn't help but urge, a clerk said that the replacement of the dishes to enter the computer kitchen to operate, so to wait more, so we seem to understand that the previous many times of confirmation and inquiry is meaningless, so why do they come to confirm a few times, the concubine really doesn't understand......"
12366,15,的确认和询问是毫无意义的，那他们为什么要来确认几次呢，臣妾实在不懂啊……上来了一个菜，因,"A dish came, because we were really hungry, so we ate happily, until we finished eating a few dragon gate formations and there was no dish."
12366,16,为实在很饿，,Orz。。。
12366,17,所以我们开心地吃了，一直到吃完摆了几个龙门阵还有个菜也没上。Orz。。。我们坐不下去了，因为已经快两个半小时了，于是我们请求结账，弱,"We couldn't sit still anymore because it was almost two and a half hours, so we asked to settle the bill, and weakly asked if we could not do with the dish, but the clerk said it was too late, but do you think we can still trust them?"
12366,18,弱地表示可否不要那个菜，可是店员说快,"We won't eat it, and we'll never dare to change the dishes in the future, okay?"
12366,19,了，可是你们觉得我们还能相信他们吗？我们不吃了，以后再也不敢换菜了好吗。我们坚,"We insisted on checking out, and then we waited for a while because the set menu was not available and it was more troublesome to check out."
12366,20,强地要求结账，然后是不是因为套餐菜没上齐结账比较麻烦，我们又等了,"Well, finally the boss happily said that it was still calculated for us according to the package, which was not possible......"
12366,21,好一会。好吧，终于老板开心滴说还是按套餐给我们算,"Hehe, but the boss is big, and the meal in our set hasn't been served yet..."
12366,22,得，本来是不可以的哦……呵呵，可是老板大大，我们套餐里的饭还没上呢。。。终于走到最后一个流程，大家都觉得可以开心地去吃另一家了,"Finally came to the last process.,Everyone thinks they can happily go to another house.,As a result, the sister who collected the money at the front desk said viciously that we had to give change.,The last one doesn't give the invoice.。。。"
12366,23,，结果前台收钱的姐姐恶恶地说让我们必须给,"It's really self-inflicted, and I won't dare to come"
12366,24,零钱，最后的最后还不给发票。。。真是自作孽不可活啊，我以后再也不敢来了。看着外面还有那么多排号等着吃饭的人我陷入了深深地自责，三个小时，菜没上齐，饭也没吃上，还让那么多人等，我再也不敢了。。。,"again. Looking at the number of people waiting to eat outside, I fell into a deep self-blame, three hours, the dishes were not served, the meals were not eaten, and so many people waited, I didn't dare anymore..."
18991,0,"小小的一家店,在六楼，之前有次路过看到有户“人家”床上有个很大的爱心型的彩灯，没想到原来就是它家。","A small shop, on the sixth floor, once passed by before and saw a ""people's house"" bed with a big heart-shaped lantern, but I didn't expect it to be its home."
18991,1,店里有三只可爱的阿汪，柯基、雪纳瑞和泰迪，貌似分别叫做monster、puppy和球球。,"There are three cute Owa in the store, Corgi, Schnauzer, and Teddy, who seem to be called Monster, Puppy, and Ballball, respectively."
18991,2,都很活泼，一拿两块小饼干逗它们，就都扒我大腿上来了，看来汪星人没有不贪吃的啊。,"are very lively, as soon as I take two small biscuits to tease them, they all pick up my thighs, it seems that Wang Xingren is not greedy."
18991,3,店里的东西不贵，楼下是咖啡甜品，楼上是可以点酒水。,"The things in the store are not expensive, there are coffee desserts downstairs, and you can order drinks upstairs."
18991,4,华夫味道一般，喝的雪顶蓝柑荔枝苏打水，挺清爽的。,"The waffle taste is average, and the snow top blue orange lychee soda you drink is quite refreshing."
18991,5,虽然东西不怎么惊艳，但是因为三只汪星人，让我对这家店印象还是很好的。,"Although the things are not very amazing, but because of the three Wang Xingren, I still have a good impression of this"
18991,6,也许也正是三只汪星人，店里生意很好。,"store. Maybe it's the three Wang Xingren, and the business in the store is very good."
33136,0,第一次来到孙府大院，刚一进门就,"The first time I came to the Sun Mansion compound, as soon as I entered the door, I had two feelings, the first was very big, and the second was very chaotic."
33136,1,给我两种感觉，第一个是很大，第二个就是很乱。我们是中午去的里面,"We went at noon, and many of the people inside were out of seats, and we waited outside for a while."
33136,2,人很多都没有位子了，我们还在外面等了一小会。当服务员带着我们去点菜的时候我都傻掉了，居然是这种,"I was stupid when the waiter took us to order, it was actually this way of ordering, okay we ended up ordering three dishes."
33136,3,（看着菜点）点菜法，好吧我们最后点了三个菜。第,"The first one is the scrambled eggs with garlic, which is really salty, especially the egg part."
33136,4,一个是蒜黄炒鸡蛋，真是太咸,The second is that egg dumplings are also hard to eat.
33136,5,了尤其是鸡蛋部分。第二个是鸡蛋饺子也很难吃。就只,"I can't remember the name of the third one, but it's really the best."
33136,6,有第三个叫什么我忘了，还真的算是最好吃的了,"The environment is very chaotic, and there are people smoking everywhere, and I hate the smell of smoke the most."
33136,7,。环境很乱，,The service is also
33136,8,还到处都有人抽烟，最讨厌烟味了。服务也很慢。总体感觉一般吧。,slow. The overall feeling is so-so.
12128,0,名气和场地都大大的hollys我居然到现在才来，其实刚开业的时候很想去凑热闹的，无耐太远太不方便，后来又听说喝的东西很糟，更没兴趣了，周末到环岛路骑车，来得太早了，怕晒，就顺便逛进来歇歇脚！,"The fame and venue are big hollys I actually came until now, in fact, when it first opened, I wanted to go to join in the fun, impatient too far too inconvenient, and then I heard that the drink was very bad, and I was not interested, I rode to the island road on the weekend, came too early, afraid of the sun, and walked in to rest!"
12128,1,\\n号称全球最大咖啡馆，装修很上档啊，怪不得游客和文青都爱来，大吊顶，大书柜，大海景，挺有腔调，一楼的后院与环岛路的木栈道相连，嫌室内闷的话可以来吹吹海风！,"\\n known as the world's largest café, the decoration is very high-grade, no wonder tourists and young people love to come, large ceiling, large bookcase, sea view, quite tone, the backyard on the first floor is connected with the wooden plank road of Huandao Road, if you think the indoor stuffiness can come to blow the sea breeze!"
12128,2,一共有两层，三楼是个室外的用餐区，不过没开放！,"There are two floors, and the third floor is an outdoor dining area, but it's not open!"
12128,3,\\n店里除了咖啡，调制饮料外，也有甜点，意面，牛排，不过从来没听人夸过，所以只点了巴黎水，小伙伴点了玫瑰汽泡水，他说不好喝，我倒觉得还行！,"In addition to coffee and drinks, there are also desserts, pasta, and steaks, but I have never heard anyone praise it, so I only ordered Perrier, and my friend ordered rose sparkling water, he said it was not delicious, I think it was okay!"
12128,4,\\n点单后工作人员会给一个定位牌，入座后记得把定位牌插到桌上的卡槽，服务员便可定位送餐了！,"\\nAfter ordering, the staff will give a positioning card, remember to insert the positioning card into the card slot on the table after taking a seat, and the waiter can locate and deliver the"
12128,5,\\n对游客来说，倒是一个很好的休息场所！,food! \\nIt's a great place to rest for tourists!
1423,0,一直没有写点评，因为这家店第一次去时感觉一般般呢，虽然人很多，所以已经不太想再去了，没想到朋友拉着说要去仓新，好吧好吧，陪朋友再去捧个场，点评定了位，结果在阁楼上信号不好，4G不通，最后点评送的券也没用上，小遗憾.\\n不过这次吃下来，又觉得很不错了，不知道是不是第一次去时量上错了还是他们确实增加了量，总之三个人狂点一气，,"I haven't written a review, because the first time I went to this store, I felt like a general, although there were a lot of people, so I didn't really want to go again, I didn't expect my friend to pull and say that I wanted to go to Cangxin, okay, okay, accompany my friends to hold a field again, and the point was assessed, and the signal was not good in the attic, 4G was not connected, and the last review sent the coupon was not used, a small pity.\\nBut this time I ate it, and I think it's very good, I don't know if it's the wrong amount when I go for the first time or they do increase the amount, in short, the three of them are crazy,"
1423,1,买单300多，好满的一盆串啊，再加兔丁，老妈蹄花，血，脑花，凉粉，及乱七八糟一堆，吃撑吃撑，好吃好吃，酸梅汤，豆奶也很好喝，中午吃的，结果晚饭就免了免了，哈哈，灵,"Pay more than 300, a pot of skewers, plus rabbits, mom's hoof flowers, blood, brain flowers, cold powder, and a mess of a bunch, eat and support, delicious, sour plum soup, soybean milk is also delicious, eat at noon, and the dinner is free, haha, Ling"
19270,0,就在投涝河那边，很好找，就是以前的胖子鱼头、感觉这家店很正，牛肉都很新鲜，各个不同的部位都有表明让你选择，而且很神奇都只有几十秒就可以吃，肉质鲜嫩，很好吃，感觉清汤锅底很干净，和以前吃的火锅没得比，这家赞的、唯一可惜牛肉丸煮的太久了给忘了，拿出来吃的时候已经很硬很老了，没有吃出应有的口感、牛肚耶只需几十秒味道好棒很有嚼劲，,"It's on the other side of the Toushui River, it's easy to find, it's the fat fish head before, I feel that this shop is very positive, the beef is very fresh, all different parts have indicated that you can choose, and it's amazing that you can eat it in only a few dozen seconds, the meat is tender, it's delicious, it feels like the bottom of the soup pot is very clean, and the hot pot I ate before is not comparable, this is a great one, the only pity is that the beef balls have been cooked for too long to forget, and when I take it out to eat, it is already very hard and old, and I don't eat the proper taste, and the tripe only takes dozens of seconds to taste good and chewy,"
19270,1,配菜方面豆腐皮好好吃，推荐噢，这家火锅吃过身上没有气味真的是棒棒的，其他火锅店吃完出来都有一股味道不知道大家有木有同感，总之感觉这店不错值得一去，人均消费蛮高的了毕竟是牛肉，大概一百多一个人，不过还是真心推荐给大家,"The side dishes are delicious, the tofu skin is delicious, recommended Oh, this hot pot has eaten no smell on the body, it is really great, other hot pot restaurants have a taste after eating, I don't know if everyone has the same feeling, in short, I feel that this store is good and worth visiting, the per capita consumption is quite high, after all, it is beef, about a hundred more than one person, but I really recommend it to everyone"
28862,0,每样菜都很精致，特别是奶黄流沙包，我一开始以为就是普通流沙包，但是第一口咬下去，蛋黄的香气跟奶香融合在一起，就像小时候在茶楼吃的流沙包。,"Every dish is very exquisite, especially the custard quicksand bun, I thought it was an ordinary quicksand bun at first, but when I bite into it for the first bite, the aroma of the egg yolk blends with the milky aroma, just like the quicksand bun I ate in the teahouse when I was a child."
28862,1,可惜现在没多少人愿意做这种既麻烦，利润又少的点心~~\\n        三文鱼撻也很出彩，裡面有蛋黃醬的原因，一點也不膩哦~三文魚的分量剛剛好~吃起來慢慢的幸福呀~~\\n        至於蝦餃呢，感覺很少茶樓能做不好，除非是粗製濫造的小茶樓\\n,"It's a pity that not many people are willing to make this kind of troublesome and less profitable dim sum now~~\\n The salmon is also very outstanding, and there is a reason for the egg yellow sauce in it, and it is not fat at all~ The amount of salmon is just good~ I am happy to eat it~~\\n As for the shrimp dumplings, I feel that there are very few tea houses that can not do well, unless they are rough and abused small tea houses\\n The environment is still like the common tea house, noisy and noisy, but the tea house should be a family getting together and chatting"
28862,2,環境還是像普遍茶樓，吵吵鬧鬧的，可是茶樓本應該就是一家人聚在一起，開開心心聊聊天嗎？預定方面基本上.9點前預定，去到就不用等咯,"heart-to-heart? In terms of pre-determination, it is basically pre-decided before 9 o'clock, so you don't have to wait to arrive"
22504,0,悦方IDmall在合肥滨湖区紫庐路口公交车站旁，是一家大型综合性生活广场，这家老芗汇火锅店就在五楼，步行电梯旁。,"Yuefang IDmall is next to the bus station at the intersection of Zilu Road, Binhu District, Hefei, which is a large comprehensive life square, and this old Xianghui hot pot restaurant is on the fifth floor, next to the elevator."
22504,1,\\n店面外观看起来不小，装修的也很精致，门口设了一个迎宾台，旁边还有店铺优惠活动的宣传广告牌。,"The appearance of the store looks not small, and the decoration is also very exquisite, with a welcome desk at the entrance and a billboard next to the store's preferential activities."
22504,2,进门是大厅，桌椅以卡座形式摆放，方便散客使用，再向内是自助调料区和餐具存放区，自助调料品种不是太多，但是质量挺好的，适合正宗火锅使用，尤其是花生碎，真香。,"The entrance is the hall, the tables and chairs are placed in the form of card seats, which is convenient for individual customers to use, and then inward is the self-service seasoning area and tableware storage area, the self-service seasoning varieties are not too much, but the quality is very good, suitable for authentic hot pot use, especially the crushed peanuts, which are really fragrant."
22504,3,\\n接下来，就是老芗汇火锅特色经营，与众不同的地方，店铺专门开辟了两间房间，一间是专门售卖熟食点心，面积较小，所售的奶皇包供不应求。,"\\nNext, it is the characteristic operation of Lao Xianghui hot pot, which is different, the store has opened up two rooms, one is dedicated to selling cooked dim sum, the area is small, and the milk queen buns sold are in short supply."
22504,4,另一间面积很大，所有菜品全部用盘子装好，用保鲜膜封好放在冷柜保鲜，上面名码标价，顾客自己看上哪个菜品，就自己拿着放在购物篮内，比看菜谱点菜直观，方便顾客选用。,"The other room has a large area, all the dishes are packed with plates, sealed with plastic wrap and placed in the freezer to keep fresh, the name code on the price is marked, and the customers themselves see which dish, they take it and put it in the shopping basket, which is more intuitive than looking at the recipe and ordering, which is convenient for customers to choose."
22504,5,这些食材选好后需直接付款，整个火锅店就像个自助超市，让人感到新鲜，同时也保证了食材的卫生。,"After these ingredients are selected, you need to pay directly, and the whole hot pot restaurant is like a self-service supermarket, which makes people feel fresh and ensures the hygiene of the ingredients."
22504,6,\\n服务员着装统一，服务态度好，效率高。,"\\nThe waiters are uniformly dressed, have a good service attitude and are efficient."
22504,7,火锅口味好，店铺推荐的虾饺不好吃，毛肚处理的也不好。,"The hot pot tastes good, the shrimp dumplings recommended by the store are not delicious, and the hairy belly is not handled well."
22504,8,推荐猪脑，牛丸，鸭肠，虾滑，培根等，味道都不错。,"Pork brain, beef balls, duck intestines, shrimp slippery, bacon, etc. are recommended, all of which taste good."
22504,9,\\n总体来说，店铺整体不错，价格适中，就餐愉快。,"Overall, the shop is good, the price is moderate, and the meal is"
22504,10,店铺还细心的在自助调料区放置薄荷糖，可缓解餐后的辣感，赞。,"pleasant. The store also carefully placed mints in the self-service seasoning area, which can relieve the spicy feeling after the meal."
3186,0,中午和同学一起出去玩，两个人都要吃庐州太太，物美价廉，是个好选择，我第一个到，就等了一个台就到我们了，可惜那两个同学上班所以在路上。,"Go out with your classmates at noon, both of you want to eat Mrs. Luzhou, good quality and low price, it is a good choice, I was the first to arrive, and I waited for a station to arrive at us, but unfortunately the two classmates went to work so on the road."
3186,1,三个人点了六个菜，都是同学喜欢吃的，可是服务员说了一句我很晕的话，你确定是三个人吃的吗？,"The three of them ordered six dishes, all of which were liked by the classmates, but the waiter said something that I was dizzy, are you sure that it was three people who ate it?"
3186,2,这一条鱼就够两个人吃了。,This fish is enough for two people.
3186,3,我谢谢他的提醒，没关系，吃不完打包。,"I thank him for the reminder, it's okay, I can't finish the packing."
3186,4,点了三味鱼，铁板土豆，什锦菜，牛排，烧烤脆骨，还有我爱吃的茶树菇。,"I ordered three-flavored fish, sizzling potatoes, assorted vegetables, steak, barbecue crispy bones, and my favorite tea tree mushroom."
3186,5,对了，还有妹妹爱吃的干粉蒸肉。,"By the way, there is also the dry tamales that my sister loves to eat."
3186,6,菜太丰富了，吃的我好撑啊。,"The dishes are so rich, I can hold on to it."
3186,7,什锦菜真不错，酸酸甜甜，里面有虾皮，火腿肠，粉丝，黄瓜，很好吃。,"The assorted dishes are really good, sweet and sour, with shrimp skin, ham sausage, vermicelli, cucumber, very delicious."
3186,8,土豆同学最爱，也很快见底，就是那条鱼太大，吃到最后还是剩下一点的。,"The potato classmate's favorite and soon bottomed out, that is, the fish was too big, and there was still a little left in the end."
3186,9,因为辣味放错了，他们喜欢吃麻辣的，点菜点了剁椒的了，其他基本光盘。,"Because the spicy taste is misplaced, they like to eat spicy food, and they order chopped peppers, other basic discs."
3186,10,没有浪费哦(⊙o⊙)哦。,No waste (⊙o⊙)
3186,11,就是一点不好，大厅人太多，有点吵，去他都很好。,"Oh. It's just not good at all, there are too many people in the hall, it's a little noisy, and it's good to go to him."
11623,0,吃了很久的辣婆婆大中秋的真心让人失望，金源店现在管理比以前差多了，收盘子的大爷帮忙上米饭，他知道碗烫也不说一声，直接把托盘举到我们面前让我们自己拿下来，这就算了，一转脸看见这个大爷在收盘子的车边上又抠鼻孔，又抠耳朵眼，还外加吐痰，真是恶心至极呀，这也算了，只能说现在辣婆婆的整体素质下降了，可是，吃着吃着，,"The spicy mother-in-law who has eaten for a long time is really disappointing, the management of Jinyuan store is now much worse than before, the uncle of the closing house helps to serve the rice, he knows that the bowl is hot and does not say a word, and directly lifts the tray in front of us and lets us take it down by ourselves, forget it, I turned my face and saw this uncle picking his nostrils on the side of the car of the closing house, picking his ears and eyes, and spitting, it is really disgusting, this is also forgotten, it can only be said that the overall quality of the spicy mother-in-law has declined now, but, eating and eating,"
11623,1,我就看见清炒豌豆尖这道菜里有个很长的黄绿色的东西，一开始以为是什么菜的叶子黄了锅没刷干净就到我们的菜里了，我就夹出来放一边了，就在我要转脸跟老公说话的时候我好像看见这个东西有头有脸有爪子，我就夹到我和老公面前仔细的看了看，一看是一条大虫子，那么长的虫子要说洗菜没洗干我觉得太牵强，怀疑他们根本不择菜，直接买回来就过一下水，,"I saw a very long yellow-green thing in the dish of fried pea tips, at first I thought it was a dish of yellow leaves and the pot was not brushed clean to our dish, I took it out and put it aside, just when I was about to turn my face and talk to my husband, I seemed to see this thing with a head, a face and claws, I clamped it in front of me and my husband and looked carefully, and saw that it was a big bug, so long insects to say that the vegetables were not washed and dried, I think it is too far-fetched, I suspect that they don't choose vegetables at all, just buy them back and pass the water,"
11623,2,你们那么大的店，那么多家连锁，要不要对客人这么不负责任？,"With such a big store and so many chains, should you be so irresponsible to your customers?"
11623,3,这让人以后还怎么来？,How will this make people come in the
11623,4,经理态度还很不耐烦，叫了几次才出来，大过节的真给人添堵，太缺德！！！,"future? The manager's attitude is still very impatient, called a few times before coming out, the big festival is really blocked, too lack of morality!!"
45699,0,早听说下一站幸福中餐厅有特别之处，今天我们中秋聚会选在了这里。,"I have heard that there is something special about the next stop of Happy Chinese Restaurant, and today we chose here for the Mid-Autumn Festival."
45699,1,中餐有两层楼，三楼是咖啡厅。,"There are two floors for Chinese food, and the third floor is a café."
45699,2,二楼的环境不错，这里菜品挺丰富，我们点了一大桌有：菌汤汽锅鸡、三丁包、莴笋肉丁、锅巴肉片、蓮白炒粉丝、果木烤鸭、小黄鱼、花蟹粥、红糖饼、小炒肉、韭香藕丝、土豆烧牛肉、拌剔骨肉、青椒海鲜汇、糊辣生菜、川北凉粉、卤排骨、擂椒茄子……,"The environment on the second floor is good, the dishes here are very rich, we ordered a big table of: mushroom soup steamed pot chicken, three Ding buns, lettuce diced meat, pot pork slices, lotus white fried vermicelli, fruit wood roast duck, small yellow croaker, flower crab porridge, brown sugar cake, small fried meat, leek lotus root, potato roast beef, mixed deboned meat, green pepper seafood exchange, paste spicy lettuce, northern Sichuan cold noodles, braised pork ribs, pepper eggplant......"
45699,3,太好吃了！,It's so
45699,4,服务员很热情，推荐的特色菜，我一一品尝的确有特色。,"delicious! The waiter was very welcoming, and the recommended specialties, I tasted them"
45699,5,小黄鱼每人烤了一条，外酥内嫰，沾干碟子吃很香，一般的烧烤店是比不上这个味道的。,"one by one. Each person grilled a small yellow croaker, crispy on the outside and on the inside, and it is very fragrant to eat on a dry plate, and the general barbecue restaurant cannot compare with"
45699,6,红糖饼果然有小时候红糖锅魁的难忘感觉，要趁热吃，一咬就有甜甜的红糖往外流，吃货们千万不要嘴谗急着吃，有点烫，好吃的还得省着吃。,"this taste. Brown sugar cake really has the unforgettable feeling of the brown sugar pot when I was a child, you have to eat it while it is hot, and there will be sweet brown sugar flowing out as soon as"
45699,7,锅巴肉片端上来的造型就吸引了我们，吃起来有调味的香和着锅巴的脆，果然成了抢手的一盘。,"you bite it. The shape of the pot slices attracted us, and it tasted seasoned and crispy, and it really became a"
45699,8,三丁包外面无论多少钱的都比不上这个味道，吃起来很香，不知道除了肉馅还有什么脆脆的，要不是菜品太多，真想多吃几个。,"sought-after plate. No matter how much money is outside, it can't compare to this taste, it tastes very fragrant, I don't know what else is crispy except for the meat filling, if it weren't for too many dishes, I"

45699,11,菌汤汽锅鸡味很鲜，里面加有松茸，有鸡的鲜味和菌的香味，不象其他餐厅加足了盐，盖过了汤的鲜美，我特地来了两碗。,"pepper eggplant is very flavorful. The mushroom soup steam pot chicken flavor is very fresh, with matsutake mushrooms added to it, with the umami of chicken and the fragrance of mushrooms, unlike other restaurants that add enough salt, covering the deliciousness of the"
45699,12,吃完了各种美味必不可少的是这家的粥很有特色，不得不留个空位一定要来碗粥，我们点的花蟹粥，粥熬的糯糯的，里面有一只大蟹，货真价实，鲜美！,"soup, I specially came to two bowls. After eating all kinds of delicious food is indispensable is that the porridge of this house is very distinctive, I have to leave a vacant seat must come to the bowl of porridge, we ordered the flower crab porridge, the porridge is glutinous, there is a"
45699,13,可惜肚子装不下了，不然……,"big crab in it, genuine, delicious! It's a pity that the"
45699,14,吃货们一定要来尝下哦！,"stomach can't fit,"
45699,15,特别要介绍的是很有情调的咖啡厅，一进三楼真是让人眼前一亮！,"otherwise......  Foodies should definitely try it!  In particular, I would like to introduce the café with a very atmospheric atmosphere, and it is"
45699,16,市中区居然有情调这么好的咖啡厅一定不能错过，无论大厅还是单间都很有格调。,really eye-catching when you enter the third floor! There is a café in Shizhong District that must not
45699,17,咖啡、奶茶、各色茶饮。,"be missed, both in the hall and in"
45699,18,还有间是专门品茶的，有打麻将的朋友也可以来这里切磋。,"the private room. Coffee, milk tea, all kinds of tea. There is also a special tea tasting, and friends who play mahjong can also come here to learn."
44580,0,在大众点评网团购了19.9元的套餐去的，感觉是我至今比较失望的一次团购。,"I bought a package of 19.9 yuan on Dianping.com, and I feel like I'm disappointed so far."
44580,1,标价19.9元日本芝士蛋糕味道一般般，胡萝卜汁非常难喝，可能本来是这个味道，但是我们不习惯所以浪费了。,"The price tag is 19.9 yuan, the Japanese cheesecake tastes average, and the carrot juice is very unpleasant, maybe it was originally this taste, but we are not used to it, so it is wasted."
44580,2,又买了22元一杯的哈密瓜汁，本来期待值好高的，因为我们本来就很喜欢吃哈密瓜，但是吸一口后，就也还是浪费了，因为味道跟生的南瓜一样。,"I bought another 22 yuan cup of cantaloupe juice, and the expectations were so high, because we liked to eat cantaloupe very much, but after taking a sip, it was still wasted, because the taste was the same as raw"
44580,3,朋友也喝了一口，也是同样的感觉，说可能是他们没有把哈密瓜的子清理干净，然后一起打成汁了，于是又浪费了一杯22块钱哈密瓜汁！,"pumpkin. My friend also took a sip and felt the same way, saying that maybe they didn't clean the cantaloupe seeds, and then beat them into juice together, so they wasted another glass of 22 yuan cantaloupe juice!"
16387,0,地方找了一会儿，餐厅环境不错，去的比较晚，人不是太多，上菜速度快，川菜量挺多的，菜点多了，其实两人一百块够吃了，我点了七八个菜，最后吃不完，打包回来，菜品不错，味道也还可以，就是依我的口味相对来说还是辣了些，上菜速度有点慢，不过菜的口味不错，慢工出细活吧。,"The place was looking for a while, the restaurant environment was good, I went late, there were not too many people, the speed of serving was fast, the amount of Sichuan cuisine was quite a lot, the dishes were more, in fact, two people were enough to eat a hundred yuan, I ordered seven or eight dishes, and finally I couldn't finish eating, packed back, the dishes were good, and the taste was OK, but according to my taste, it was relatively spicy, and the speed of serving was a little slow, but the taste of the dishes was good, and the slow work was fine."
16387,1,服务员态度都很好，有事一叫就会过来帮你解决。,"The waiters are very good, and they will come to help you solve something as soon as they are called."
16387,2,豆腐很好吃，就是有点咸。,"The tofu is delicious, just a little salty."
16387,3,孜然牛肉也很好吃就是口味有点重，不过很下饭。,"Cumin beef is also very delicious, but the taste is a bit heavy, but it goes well with rice."
16387,4,虾球很好吃，就是数量有点少。,"The shrimp balls are delicious, but the quantity is a little"
16387,5,扬州炒饭很软，很好吃，就是吃不下了，最后只好打包，下次有机会再去。,"small. Yangzhou fried rice is very soft and delicious, but I can't eat it, so I have to pack it in the end, and I will go again next time I have a chance."
607,0,pelicana韩国炸鸡店，其实我一直对这些炸的东西不怎么感冒；,"Pelicana Korean fried chicken restaurant, in fact, I have never been very interested in these fried things;"
607,1,但是女朋友比较喜欢，就陪过来尝尝；,"But my girlfriend likes it more, so I accompany me to try it;"
607,2,个人感觉还行吧！,"Personally, I feel okay!"
607,3,女朋友超级喜欢，一个人吃得津津有味。,My girlfriend likes it super and eats it with relish alone.
607,4,\\n,"\\n Drink: I forgot what the name of Shenma was, it tasted very good, and I packed a can back after drinking a can."
607,5,饮料：忘记叫什么神马名字了，味道挺好喝的，喝完一罐还打包了一罐,\\n Original Fried Chicken Wings: This one is more dry and crispy;
607,6,回去。\\n,"The heat is properly mastered, keeping the juices locked inside."
607,7,原味炸鸡翅：这个比较干身的做，吃起来比较香脆；火候掌握得适当，保持了肉汁在里面封锁着。\\n,"\\n Sweet fried chicken wings: My girlfriend prefers this taste, sweet and sour, like the taste of Korean grilled pork ribs;"
607,8,甜味炸鸡翅：女朋友比较喜欢这个口味，甜中带酸，好像那个韩式烤排骨的味道；我就不太喜欢，吃多两囗就觉得有点腻。\\n     总的来说还过得去吧！,"much. \\n Overall, it's okay!"
38806,0,这家店附近交通便利，就位于八号线黄兴路站傍边，靠近kfc一侧。,"This store is conveniently located next to Huangxing Road Station on Line 8, near the KFC side."
38806,1,之前去过几次，感觉当中的菜经济实惠，适合家庭聚会。,"I've been there a few times before, and I feel that the food is affordable and suitable for family gatherings."
38806,2,\\n这家的酸菜鱼不错，黑鱼肉鲜嫩，口感酸爽。,"\\nThe sauerkraut fish here is good, the black fish is tender and has a sour taste."
38806,3,蒜香骨外层焦香，带手套吃更爽快。,"The outer layer of garlic bone is burnt and fragrant, and it is more refreshing to eat with gloves."
38806,4,糯米蒸排骨不行，糯米太硬，排骨味道淡。,"Steamed pork ribs with glutinous rice is not good, the glutinous rice is too hard, and the pork ribs have a light taste."
38806,5,菌菇汤非常鲜，可是里面的鸡肉有点老。,"The mushroom soup is very fresh, but the chicken inside is a bit old."
38806,6,干锅花菜一般，其中花菜有点烂。,"The dry pot cauliflower is average, in which the cauliflower is a little rotten."
38806,7,最后是每次去都要点的沙律小牛排和玉米烙，是小盆友最爱吃的。,"Finally, the salad veal steak and corn roast that I want to order every time I go, which are the favorite of small pot friends."
38806,8,\\n店里还有一个阿三做飞饼，逗得小盆友前仰后合的。,"\\nThere is also a Ah San in the store who makes flying cakes, which makes the little pot friend lean forward and"
38806,9,做完小盆友又不吃，真心被他打败了。,"back. After making a small pot friend, he didn't eat it, and he was really defeated."
6548,0,以前经常来这家店，位置就在阳春巷的负一楼，金池对面。,"I used to come to this store often, and the location is on the first floor of Yangchun Lane, opposite Jinchi."
6548,1,以前都是坐的卡座，今天是坐的包厢，才知道一共有三层楼的，还挺大的。,"I used to sit in a booth, but today I sit in a box, and I know that there are three floors, which is quite large."
6548,2,今天孕妈们说要搓麻将，于是就想到了这里。,"Today, pregnant mothers said that they wanted to play mahjong, so they thought of here."
6548,3,包厢说已经是豪包了，就是多了张自动麻将桌，包厢内空间不大，不过还好有窗户，不至于太闷。,"The box said that it was already a luxury bag, that is, there was an automatic mahjong table, and the space in the box was not large, but fortunately there were windows, so it would not be too stuffy."
6548,4,茶水自助，按铃后服务员来的挺快的，比以前在楼下人多的时候按了半天没人理的情况好多了。,"Tea buffet, the waiter came very quickly after the bell, much better than the situation that no one paid attention to for a long time when there were many people downstairs."
6548,5,点了杯玉米牛奶，太甜太黏了，后来改了薏仁紫薯汁，失望，估计是用粉冲泡的，都没有冲泡完全，喝的时候还能吃到里面未完全冲泡的粉…,"I ordered a cup of corn milk, it was too sweet and sticky, and then I changed it to barley purple potato juice, disappointed, it is estimated that it was brewed with powder, and it was not brewed completely, and when I drank it, I could still eat the powder that was not completely brewed inside..."
6548,6,后来想想还是点个简单的蜂蜜柠檬水吧，蜂蜜味是吃到了，可是也太甜了吧，不知道是不是糖加多了…,"Later, I thought about it or order a simple honey lemonade, the honey flavor is eaten, but it's too sweet, I don't know if it's too much sugar..."
6548,7,后来干脆就不点喝的了…,"After that, I simply didn't order it..."
6548,8,只能说我们都是特殊时期冷的喝不了，热的又做的不行。,"It can only be said that we can't drink cold during special periods, and we can't do hot"
6548,9,现在自助有团购，原价40，团购价30，还算划算。,"ones. Now there is a group purchase for self-service, the original price is 40, and the group purchase price is 30, which is quite cost-effective."
22658,0,想请外地朋友吃饭，除了上海菜四川菜广东菜还真不知道吃什么。,"I want to invite friends from other places to eat, but I really don't know what to eat except Shanghai food, Sichuan food, and Cantonese food."
22658,1,无意中看到藏川菜，这可大大的吸引了我呀。,"I accidentally saw Tibetan Sichuan cuisine, which greatly attracted me."
22658,2,吃西藏风味菜的地方本来就不多，更何况像这儿还有设计感装修的更是稀奇呀!,"There are not many places to eat Tibetan cuisine, not to mention that there is a sense of design and decoration like here!"
22658,3,立马订了位当晚就来吃。,I immediately booked a table and came to eat that night.
22658,4,订位时服务员还好心的问要不要先订烤羊腿，因为制作时间比较长。,"When making a reservation, the waiter kindly asked if he wanted to order a roast leg of lamb first, because it took a long time to make."
22658,5,菜谱里真的很多少见的菜色，好多都想全部点一遍，但这次人少，还是适可而止吧。,"There are really many dishes in the menu, and I want to order them all, but this time there are few people, so let's stop in moderation."
22658,6,烤羊腿比想像中好入口，不干不柴，还切好上桌，沾了特制辣酱可以不配饭吃好几片。,"The roast leg of lamb is better than expected, it is not dry or woody, and it is also cut and served, and it can be eaten without rice with a special hot sauce."
22658,7,酥油饼也特别好吃，虽然没馅料，但外脆内绵还回甘，沾点菜的酱汁也是完全契合的。,"The butter cake is also very delicious, although there is no filling, it is crispy on the outside and sweet on the inside, and the sauce for dipping in the dish is also completely"
22658,8,其他菜也都不错没有不好吃的，推荐想找特别口味又敢尝试新餐厅的朋友来试试。,"suitable. The other dishes are also good, there is nothing bad to eat, and it is recommended for friends who want to find a special taste and dare to try a new restaurant."
19409,0,屋头有个喜欢苏杭一切视苏杭为第二故乡的妹，自然早耳闻“绿茶”大名。,"There is a sister at the head of the house who likes everything in Suzhou and Hangzhou and regards Suzhou and Hangzhou as her second hometown, so she has naturally heard of the name of ""green tea""."
19409,1,由于太古里店人多的天天顿顿都要排位，实在是莫的等位的心。,"Due to the large number of people in the Taikoo Li store, it is really Mo's waiting heart."
19409,2,\\n今天是绿茶万象城新店第一天开业，除水产、甜品、酒水外其余打六折。,"\\nToday is the first day of the opening of the new store in the green tea mixc, except for aquatic products, desserts, and wines, the rest are discounted by 6%."
19409,3,胜在离家近，下午3点半就来取号了。,"The victory is close to home, and I came to pick up the number at 3:30 in the afternoon."
19409,4,\\n五点二十到店一看，已经人山人海了。,"\\nWhen I arrived at the store at 5:20, it was already crowded."
19409,5,\\n终于进店入座，点有绿茶烤鸡肉合拼、果蔬沙拉、三样菜、椒香蛙、年糕炒牛仔骨、花生莲藕排骨汤。,"\\nFinally, I entered the restaurant and ordered green tea roasted chicken assortment, fruit and vegetable salad, three kinds of vegetables, pepper frog, fried cowboy bones with rice cake, and pork rib soup with peanut and lotus root."
19409,6,三样菜就焯过水的豇豆，藕，苦瓜合拌，口味太淡吃不惯。,"The three dishes are blanched cowpeas, lotus root, and bitter gourd, and the taste is too light to eat."
19409,7,好吃的是绿茶烤鸡肉里的烤肉，我们点了两次，而且一定要趁热吃，肥而不腻，瘦肉也嫩，相比较，烤鸡肉的肉质就有点柴了。,"The delicious is the barbecue in the green tea roast chicken, we ordered it twice, and it must be eaten while it is hot, fat but not greasy, lean meat is also tender, in comparison, the meat quality of the roast chicken is a bit chai."
19409,8,其他菜不功不过。,Other dishes are not to the task.
19409,9,\\n在万象城这样的环境下，菜品不错，价格适中。,"\\nIn an environment like the MixC, the dishes are good and the prices are"
19409,10,下次再试试其他的菜。,moderate. Try other dishes next time.
26380,0,最近朋友圈里刷屏的一家餐厅，慕名而来，下午五点不到上座率已经达到90%，完全符合茶餐厅的样子，人很多，也很吵杂，不只是顾客的交流声，更大的是收拾盘子之类的声音，并不是个可以安静吃饭聊天的地方。,"Recently, a restaurant in the circle of friends swiped the screen, admiring it, the attendance rate has reached 90% before five o'clock in the afternoon, which is completely in line with the appearance of a tea restaurant, there are a lot of people, and it is also very noisy, not only the communication of customers, but also the sound of cleaning up the plates, and it is not a place where you can eat and chat quietly."
26380,1,上菜速度较慢，每道菜都有等很久，菜的口味还可以，没吃过真宗的粤菜，所以没什么比较，但和南京一般的粤菜餐厅感觉差不多。,"The speed of serving is slow, each dish has to wait for a long time, the taste of the dish is OK, I have not eaten the real Cantonese cuisine, so there is no comparison, but it feels similar to the general Cantonese restaurant in"
26380,2,点的茶走、猪仔包，法式长面包、咖喱牛腩、云吞、猪排饭，茶走茶味很重，有点涩口，加了一包糖感觉很好喝，猪仔包甜而不腻很好吃，长面包里熏肠的味道很重，搭配起来也很不错，咖喱牛腩的咖喱味道不重，所以不太喜欢，云吞的里满满的虾仁，吃起来很爽口，猪排饭就有点失望，饭是软的软硬的硬，芝士不多，里面的配菜是胡萝卜，吃起来没有什么味道。,"Nanjing. The tea left, piglet buns, French baguettes, curry brisket, wonton, pork chop rice, the tea taste is very strong, a little astringent, it feels very delicious with a pack of sugar, the piglet buns are sweet but not greasy and delicious, the taste of smoked sausage in the long bread is very heavy, and the curry taste of curry brisket is not heavy, so I don't like it very much, the wonton is full of shrimp, it tastes very refreshing, the pork chop rice is a little disappointed, the rice is soft and hard and hard, there is not much cheese, the side dish inside is carrots, and there is no taste in it."
23817,0,我觉得蟹没有洗干净，但是肉蟹煲的味道比别的味道好！,"I don't think the crab is cleaned, but the taste of the meat crab pot is better than the others!"
23817,1,看评论说年糕好吃，可是我觉得年糕已经太烂了，没有咬劲了，并不是好年糕！,"I read the reviews that the rice cakes are delicious, but I think the rice cakes are too bad and have no bite, so they are not good rice cakes!"
23817,2,反倒是凤爪尽管酥烂，却也入味！,"On the contrary, although the phoenix feet are crispy, they also taste good!"
23817,3,\\n,"\\n Meal ོ can ོ not ོ can make ོ dry ོ net ོ point ོ ah ོ, like ོ is ོ is ོ used ོ eight ོ hundred ོ years ོ up, that ོ cup ོ and chopsticks ོ simple ོ straight ོ not ོ want to spit out the groove ོ up, estimate ོ meter light light ོ engage ོ into ོ this ོ like ོ except ོ is ོ a kind of wind ོ grid ོ to ོ outside ོ also ོ is ོ for ོ mold paste ོ view line"

38162,0,这家店在北行往前走那条街上，位置按照点评地图来找还是很好找的。,"This shop is on the street in front of the northbound line, and the location is still easy to find according to the review map."
38162,1,店铺给人感觉不是很大，但是进屋却发现并不拥挤，而且还有二楼。,"The shop doesn't feel very big, but when you enter the house, you find that it is not crowded, and there is a second floor."
38162,2,\\n买了一张代金券比较合适，又补了三十的现金，整顿饭下来才一百二左右，很划算的。,"\\nI bought a voucher and made up thirty cash, and the whole meal was only about one hundred and twelve, which was very cost-effective."
38162,3,\\n他家很多网友推荐的我都点了，比如铁板玉米粒，里面都是酸奶的味道，非常好吃！,"\\nI ordered the ones recommended by many netizens in his family, such as sizzling corn kernels, which are full of yogurt flavor, very delicious!"
38162,4,大赞！,Great praise!
38162,5,拉面炒年糕也太辣了，有点来不了。,The ramen fried rice cake is also too spicy to come.
38162,6,草莓那个饮料不错，但是有点小贵。,"Strawberry drink is good, but a little expensive."
38162,7,炸鸡虽然要的是果酱的，但是果酱有点太少了吧，不过味道还是很不错的。,"Although the fried chicken is made with jam, the jam is a little too little, but it still tastes very good."
38162,8,\\n他家点餐完毕要先交钱后上餐，给人感觉有点要抢钱的意思，这样还是再点餐感觉很麻烦了。,"\\nAfter his family orders the food, he has to pay the money before serving, which gives people the feeling that they want to grab money, so it feels very troublesome to order"
38162,9,\\n性价比挺高的一家店，推荐哦。,"again. \\nA very cost-effective store, recommended."
19815,0,带着父母慕名而来，可是让我略微有点失望，客人不多但服务员态度比较冷淡，点菜时有点不耐烦。,"I came with my parents, but I was a little disappointed, there were not many guests but the waiter was relatively cold, and I was a little impatient when ordering."
19815,1,我们都点了特色菜。,We all ordered specials.
19815,2,【松鼠桂鱼】甜中带酸价位属于贵的，而味道我也能在上海的一般饭店里吃得到，没有想象的那么赞。,"【Squirrel Guiyu】The price of sweet and sour is expensive, and the taste can also be eaten in ordinary restaurants in Shanghai, which is not as good as I imagined."
19815,3,【得月小炒】就是只看见鸡头米和藕块，味道清淡，78元的价位并不值。,"[Deyue Stir-fry] is only to see chicken head rice and lotus root, the taste is light, and the price of 78 yuan is not worth it."
19815,4,【蟹粉豆腐】这个菜还比较满意，蟹粉比较多。,"【Crab Roe Tofu】This dish is quite satisfying, and there is more crab roe."
19815,5,【梅菜扣肉】肉非常嫩，入口即化，梅菜又甜又糯，这个菜可以的。,"【Plum cabbage button meat】The meat is very tender, it melts in the mouth, the plum cabbage is sweet and glutinous, this dish is okay."
19815,6,【油爆虾】做的非常入味，虾也比较大。,"【Fried shrimp】It is very flavorful, and the shrimp is relatively large."
19815,7,【酒酿圆子】这个最最需要吐槽，简直是个败笔，端上来是温的，汤水我没有勾芡就像清汤一样，小圆子都粘在一起沉在碗底，这个菜我都不高兴拍照了。,"[Wine-stuffed balls] this is the most important to complain, it's a failure, it's warm when served, I didn't thicken the soup like a clear soup, the small balls are stuck together and sink at the bottom of the bowl, I am not happy to take pictures of this"
19815,8,总的来说不会再来第二次了,dish. Overall will not come back a second time
11709,0,吃水煮鱼的话非新煮意莫属啊！,"If you eat boiled fish, it must be a new cooking!"
11709,1,由于只有两个人，想挑一条小一点的鱼，不过服务员一直推荐我们点一份的。,"Since there were only two people, we wanted to pick a smaller fish, but the waiter kept recommending us to order one."
11709,2,自认为论份的和论斤称的味道不太一样，而且一份的鱼对于我们两个吃货也太少了点，还是坚持了论斤称。,"I think that the taste of the argument is not the same as the argument of the pound, and a portion of the fish is too little for the two of us foodies, so I still insisted on the pound."
11709,3,挑到一条两斤七两，主力就是吃鱼来的嘛，我们两个人也吃的差不多。,"Pick a two catties and seven taels, the main force is to eat fish, and the two of us also eat about the same."
11709,4,这的水煮鱼属于只麻不辣，虽然端上来飘满了红辣椒，其实一点都不辣，但是味道很香，而且够麻，一级棒！,"This boiled fish is only spicy, although it is served full of red peppers, in fact, it is not spicy at all, but the taste is very fragrant, and it is numb enough, first-class great!"
11709,5,\\n怕鱼吃多了会腻，点了一个水果大拌菜，好像是用苹果汁和雪碧调的汁，还不错。,"\\nI was afraid that I would get tired of eating too much fish, so I ordered a fruit salad, which seemed to be made with apple juice and Sprite, which was not"
11709,6,水果茶也很好喝，担担面也好吃，不过那个豆花可不好吃，太甜了……,"bad. The fruit tea is also delicious, and the dandan noodles are also delicious, but the bean curd is not delicious, it is too sweet......"
17030,0,大众点评奖抽到朱朱农家乐多人套餐免费吃，电话预约后，跟着导航仪开去，一路上风光如画。,"The public review prize was drawn to the Zhuzhu Farmhouse multi-person package for free, and after making an appointment by phone, follow the navigator and drive away, and the scenery along the way is picturesque."
17030,1,从湖滨路拐进乡路后，在老板娘的电话指点下，很快就找到了朱朱农家乐。,"After turning from Hubin Road to Xiang Road, under the guidance of the proprietress's phone, I quickly found Zhu Zhu Farmhouse."
17030,2,车到那儿，眼前豁然开朗，一大片湖水，碧波荡漾，湖里养着鹅鸭，泊着供食客游玩的游船。,"When the car arrives there, the eyes suddenly open up, a large lake with rippling blue waves, geese and ducks in the lake, and pleasure boats for diners to play."
17030,3,\\n\\n朱朱农家乐临湖而建，雪白的粉墙上，大红的店名很是醒目，墙前有花架花草，喜气而时尚。,"\\n\\nZhu Zhu Farmhouse is built near the lake, on the snow-white powder wall, the red store name is very eye-catching, there are flower stands in front of the wall, festive and fashionable."
17030,4,院子宽敞洁净，可停好几辆汽车。,"The yard is spacious and clean, and there is room for several cars."
17030,5,院子一角停着供食客骑游的自行车。,"In the corner of the yard, bicycles are parked for diners."
17030,6,这儿有免费wifi，有男女卫生间。,There is free Wi-Fi and men's and women's toilets.
17030,7,楼房里有大小包厢。,There are large and small private rooms in the building.
17030,8,临湖建有木顶大棚，下设餐桌餐凳。,"There is a wood-roofed greenhouse near the lake, and there are dining tables and stools under it."
17030,9,天洒小雨，前来用餐者不少，大多是上海人，不少还是回头客。,"There was a light rain on the day, and there were many people who came to dine, most of them were Shanghainese, and many of them were repeat customers."
17030,10,\\n\\n我们当然选择在湖边大棚用餐。,"\\n\\nOf course, we chose to dine in a tent by the lake."
17030,11,那儿视野开阔，空气清新，凉风阵阵，还有大群白鹅相伴，舒适写意至极。,"There is a wide view, fresh air, cool breezes, and a large flock of white geese, which is extremely comfortable and freehand."
17030,12,年轻清秀的老板娘接待热情周到，有宾至如归之感。,The young and handsome hostess was warm and attentive and made her feel at home.
17030,13,上菜了，小葱跑蛋色泽金黄，葱花碧绿，香气扑鼻；,"When the dish is served, the shallot running egg is golden in color, the green onion is green, and the aroma is tangy;"
17030,14,盐水河虾、酱爆螺丝只只新鲜味美，原汁原味的农家味；,"Saltwater river shrimp and sauce fried screws are only fresh and delicious, and the original farmhouse flavor;"
17030,15,一大盆六月黄，壳薄黄多，一嚼满嘴鲜香，超级鲜美；,"A large pot of June yellow, the shell is thin and yellow, and the mouth is full of fresh and fragrant when chewed, super delicious;"
17030,16,最为惊艳的是红烧鳊鱼，那个大呀，起码要二斤半以上，浓油赤酱，鱼肉紧致细嫩，味道不是一般的好哈！,"The most amazing thing is the braised bream, which is big, at least more than two and a half catties, thick oil red sauce, the fish meat is firm and tender, and the taste is not ordinary!"
17030,17,炒青菜和土鸡汤味道也很赞。,The stir-fried vegetables and local chicken soup also taste great.
17030,18,菜量大，味鲜美，我们四人都吃撑了，真正是大快朵颐！,"The amount of dishes is large, the taste is delicious, and the four of us have eaten it, and we are really feasting!"
17030,19,\\n\\n餐后，我们没去骑游、乘游船，由老板娘指引，去采摘了葡萄。,"\\n\\nAfter the meal, we didn't go on a ride or a cruise, and we were guided by the hostess to pick grapes."
17030,20,老板娘毕业于苏州的大学，怪不得品位不俗，把个农家乐搞得这样有情调。,"The proprietress graduated from a university in Suzhou, no wonder she has good taste and makes a farmhouse so emotional."
17030,21,去之前绝对想不到,"Before I went, I would never have imagined that Bacheng would hide such a farmhouse with beautiful scenery, beautiful dishes and beautiful paradise."
17030,22,，巴城竟隐藏着这么一家风光美、菜肴美、美如世外桃源的农家乐。,"Before we left, we thought that next time we would call friends and come to Zhuzhu"
17030,23,我们人还没离开，心里就想着下次要呼朋唤友，再来朱朱农家乐了。\\n\\n,Farmhouse. \\n\\n
1882,0,上一次本来想吃，但是晚上人多而且服务感觉不好，就被气走了。,"I wanted to eat it last time, but there were many people at night and the service didn't feel good, so I was angry and left."
1882,1,这次聚餐选的这边，还是来试试吧。,"The side chosen for this dinner, let's try it."
1882,2,中午人不多，比较舒服，走菜也快。,"There are not many people at noon, it is more comfortable, and the food is fast."
1882,3,点的都是大家好评的菜，鲈鱼，蒜香骨，感觉不错，日本豆腐也还好，蛏子肥肥的也很不错，茶皇虾我觉得普通，虾子少，茶叶多一点。,"The dishes ordered are all well received by everyone, sea bass, garlic bones, it feels good, Japanese tofu is also good, razor clams are also very good, tea king shrimp I think ordinary, shrimp less, tea tea a little more."
1882,4,要的黑雕的鱼生，鱼骨做粥，但是感觉粥炖的时间太短，味道不浓，鱼生上来的时候大家都在惊呼：鱼肉在哪里？,"I want the fish sheng of the black eagle, the fish bones make porridge, but I feel that the porridge stew time is too short, the taste is not strong, and when the fish is born, everyone is exclaiming: Where is the fish?"
1882,5,好吧，因为鱼肉实在是太薄了！,"Well, because the fish is so thin!"
1882,6,148的鱼生，感觉还不够塞牙缝，下次还是吃三文鱼刺身得了！,"148 yusheng, I don't feel like it's enough to stuff my teeth, next time I can eat salmon"
1882,7,榴莲酥还不错，榴莲量多，货真价实~ 总体还是满意的，不过鱼生觉得有点贵了！,"sashimi! The durian crisp is not bad, the amount of durian is large, and the goods are genuine~ Overall I am still satisfied, but Yusheng thinks it is a bit expensive!"
38150,0,这家店在云岗开了很多很多年，最开始的时候很火爆，量足价格也实惠，基本每周都去个一两次。,"This store has been open in Yungang for many, many years, and it was very popular at the beginning, and the price was affordable, so I basically went once or twice a week."
38150,1,后来分店也开的多了，菜价也上去了，但是菜品质量下降严重。,"Later, more branches were opened, and the price of dishes also increased, but the quality of the dishes declined seriously."
38150,2,人气没有以前旺了，但饭点也还有上座率，一层南侧有一个个小隔断的包间，比较私密，可以坐4人，就是推拉门设计的好，这边人进去，那边人就肯定出不来，服务员上菜的时候也费劲。,"The popularity is not as strong as before, but the meal also has the attendance rate, there is a small partition on the south side of the first floor, which is more private, you can sit 4 people, it is a good design of the sliding door, people here go in, people over there will definitely not be able to get out, and the waiter will also struggle when serving the food."
38150,3,#宫保鸡丁#这菜实在是“赞”，几十元买一盘宫保大葱和不脆的花生米。,"#宫保鸡丁#这菜实在是 ""like"", a few dozen yuan to buy a plate of kung pao green onions and non-crispy peanuts."
38150,4,#扇贝#扇贝应该是不完整的吧，因为扇贝的壳够大，但是里面那块味如嚼蜡的死肉挺小，值得肯定的是扇贝上面的蒜蓉粉丝味道不错。,"#扇贝#扇贝应该是不完整的吧, because the shell of the scallop is large enough, but the piece of dead meat that tastes like chewing wax inside is quite small, it is worth affirming that the garlic vermicelli on the scallop tastes good."
38150,5,#铁板茄子#大概是这个名字，原来是必点，长条茄子里面有肉馅，放在铁板上端上来甜甜的很好吃，但是这次的我翻来翻去找肉馅，几乎没有！,"#铁板茄子#大概是这个名字, it turned out to be a must-order, the long eggplant has meat filling in it, and it is sweet and delicious when served on the iron plate, but this time I rummaged through it to find the meat filling, and there was almost none!"
38150,6,#米粉肉#巨肥，直接浪费了，实在没法入口。,"#米粉肉#巨肥, it's wasted directly, and it really can't be entered."
38150,7,#咸蛋黄南瓜#还是可以的，水准没有降低，趁热吃不错。,"#咸蛋黄南瓜#还是可以的, the level has not decreased, and it is good to eat it while it is hot."
38150,8,#豆腐#大概就是豆腐里面夹着肉馅，还行。,"#豆腐#大概就是豆腐里面夹着肉馅, it's ok."
38150,9,点评服务，我们3个人，点了六七个菜，其中2个有小份，我特别重复要小份，上来的全部是大份，先不说钱的问题，吃不了就都浪费了！,"Comment service, 3 of us, ordered six or seven dishes, 2 of which have small portions, I especially repeated to small portions, all the ones that came up are large portions, not to mention the problem of money, can't eat it is wasted!"
38150,10,希望贵店加强培训，不建议顾客要小份就算了，在顾客强调要小份的时候还直接点了大份，你们差那几十块钱吗？,"I hope that your store will strengthen training, and it is not recommended that customers want small portions, and when customers emphasize that they want small portions, they also directly order large portions, are you short of dozens of dollars?"
38150,11,直接给你们当小费都行，能不浪费食物吗？！,"I can just tip you guys, can I not waste"
38150,12,本次翠满楼之行着实失望，肯定不会再去了。,"food?! This trip to Cuimanlou is really disappointing, and I will definitely not go again."
23068,0,感谢点评的代金卷，店很好找，离地铁很近，交通方便。,"Thanks for the review of the voucher, the shop is easy to find, close to the subway, convenient transportation."
23068,1,店面虽然不大楼上楼下两层，但是装修很别致，餐位错落有致，很有感觉。,"Although the store does not have two floors up and down, the decoration is very chic, and the dining places are scattered, which is very feeling."
23068,2,周末去的，人略多，需要等一会。,"I went on the weekend, there were slightly more people, so I had to wait a while."
23068,3,重庆老灶火锅最著名的当然是九宫格，,"The most famous Chongqing Laozao hot pot is, of course, Jiugongge, but recently I can't eat spicy and ask for a clear soup pot, and a big pot comes up, and my appetite is immediately suspended."
23068,4,但是最近不能吃辣就要了清汤锅，一大锅上来，胃口立马被吊了起来。首先清汤锅底非常便宜，30左右但是里面的料可是给的十足，真心超值值，各种菇类，平菇，香菇，金针菇等，都,"First of all, the bottom of the clear soup pot is very cheap, about 30, but the ingredients inside are full, really value-for-money, all kinds of mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, etc., are almost a platter of amounts, the soup is also very delicious, and it feels very good to drink a little before the meat."
23068,5,差不多有个拼盘的量了，汤也很鲜美，下肉之前喝上一点感觉很不错。点的鲜,"The fresh mutton and tender beef ordered are full of portions, the meat is very fresh, the cut is also very even, and the taste is very good."
23068,6,羊肉和嫩牛肉，分量十足，肉很,The green cabbage is very appetizing when it looks green.
23068,7,新鲜，切的也很均匀，涮着口感很好。青菜绿油油的看着就很有食欲,"The material platter is great value and filling, and if two or three people eat it, you don't have to order other vegetables."
23068,8,。素材拼盘很超值，量足，如果两三个人吃，就不用再点其他蔬菜了。毛肚也很不错，应该是,"The hairy belly is also very good, it should be a specialty here, it is clean, and it is crispy and tender to eat, so you must order it."
23068,9,这里的特色菜，处理的干净，涮起来吃着脆脆的，嫩嫩的，一定要点。火锅小料是自助式的，,"The hot pot ingredients are self-service, 6 yuan, the categories are very complete, I love sesame sauce, of course, there are some xo sauces and sand tea sauces and the like."
23068,10,6元，品类很齐全，最爱麻酱，当然还有一些xo酱和沙茶酱之类,"\\nThe main food is recommended for the baked cake, sesame, crunchy, slightly oily, but very fragrant."
23068,11,的。\\n主食推荐烧饼，芝麻的，脆脆的，略微有点油，但是很香。\\n店里的服务也不错，点菜积极，,"The service in the store is also good, the order is positive, the food is served quickly, the soup is added and removed in a timely manner, and there is also a warm greeting and introduction when entering the"
23068,12,上菜速度快，加汤撤盘都很及时，进门的时候也有热情的招呼和引位。\\n总之是一次非常好的体验，下次有机会还会去。,"door. \\nAll in all a very good experience, will go next time I have the chance."
3952,0,之前和小伙伴在南门的店吃过一次，那次等了快两个小时结果被人插队，不过老板娘很好，安排我们去了包厢，后来吃的还是挺愉快的。,"I had eaten with my friends in the South Gate store once, and I waited for almost two hours and was cut in line, but the proprietress was very good and arranged for us to go to the box, and then the food was quite pleasant."
3952,1,\\n所以，这次刚刚开学我就请几个小伙伴去新开的封门点吃酸菜鱼了。,"\\nSo, just after the start of school this time, I invited a few friends to eat sauerkraut fish at the newly opened closed door."
3952,2,\\n之前看了下评价，说人很多，所以今天特地早点出发，十点四十的时候就到店里了。,"\\nI read the evaluation before, saying that there are a lot of people, so I set off early today and arrived at the store at 10:40."
3952,3,但是我们四个人站在楼下，叫了半天，两个服务员都没有理我们，然后我脾气就上来了，大声说排位，说了几次才理我们的。,"But the four of us stood downstairs and called for a long time, and the two waiters ignored us, and then my temper came up, and I shouted about the ranking, and only after saying a few times did I ignore us."
3952,4,然后那个给我们抓鱼的男服务员态度特别差，一开始拿了条3.7斤的鱼，我说太大了换条小的，因为都是女孩子，胃口不大，吃不完，还要吃别的菜和涮菜。,"Then the waiter who caught the fish for us had a very bad attitude, and at first took a 3.7 pound fish, I said that it was too big to change to a small one, because they were all girls, and they didn't have a big appetite, so they couldn't finish eating, and they had to eat other dishes and shabu-shabu."
3952,5,结果那个男服务员不愿意，后来后面来的人说他们可以就给他们了，我觉得被变相插队了。,"As a result, the waiter was unwilling, and then the person who came behind said that they could give it to them, and I felt that I was cut in line in disguise."
3952,6,后来拿了条2.3斤的鱼，我觉得有点小，说给换一条稍微大点的，结果男服务员直接就帮我们纪录了，送去煮了。,"Later, I took a 2.3-pound fish, I thought it was a little small, and said to change it to a slightly larger one, but the waiter directly helped us record it and sent it to be cooked."
3952,7,我觉得好奇怪，还不让换鱼的，说话也不理，态度太差了！,"I think it's so strange, I don't let me change the fish, I don't pay attention to my talk, my attitude is too bad!"
3952,8,\\n上去以后点了两个菜，干锅包菜和椒盐排条。,"\\nAfter going up, I ordered two dishes, cabbage and salt and pepper strips."
3952,9,干锅包菜甜甜的，味道还可以，就是太油了，吃了一半以后包菜都在油里面，就没吃了。,"The cabbage in the dry pot is sweet and the taste is okay, but it is too oily, and after eating half of it, the cabbage is in the oil, so I didn't eat it."
3952,10,椒盐排条很好吃，面粉也不多。,"The salt-and-pepper strips are delicious, and there is not much flour."
3952,11,本来以为这两个菜会先上的，结果等到鱼吃的差不多了才上。,"I thought that these two dishes would be served first, but I didn't serve them until the fish was almost eaten."
3952,12,\\n涮菜点了八个。,\\nShabu-shabu ordered eight.
3952,13,白菜，土豆，冻豆腐，香菇，年糕，肥牛，牛百叶，金针菇。,"Cabbage, potatoes, frozen tofu, shiitake mushrooms, rice cakes, fat beef, beef shutters, enoki mushrooms."
3952,14,牛百叶很好吃，白菜的量很足，年糕是长的不是一片片的，很喜欢。,"The beef shutters are delicious, the amount of cabbage is very large, and the rice cakes are long and not slices, so I like it very much."
3952,15,但是肥牛不好吃，觉得味道怪怪的。,"But the fat cow is not delicious, and I think it tastes weird."
3952,16,其他的菜就很常规了。,The rest of the dishes are pretty conventional.
3952,17,\\n楼上的服务员态度很好，比楼下的好多了，很积极的问我们要不要开火，要不要加汤。,"\\nThe waiter upstairs had a good attitude, much better than downstairs, and actively asked us if we wanted to open the fire and add soup."
3952,18,还告诉我们晒微信能在团购的基础上再打97折。,also told us that WeChat can be discounted by 97% on the basis of group purchases.
3952,19,\\n以前南门的鱼只有酸汤的，站在这里啊新店多了辣的。,"\\nIn the past, the fish at the south gate was only sour soup, but standing here, the new store is more spicy."
3952,20,不过我还是点的酸汤的。,But I still ordered the sour soup.
3952,21,酸菜鱼的鱼片很嫩，而且没有刺，很好吃，里面的酸萝卜感觉没有南门的好吃，宽粉还是一如既往的很好吃。,"The sauerkraut fish fillet is very tender, and there are no spines, it is delicious, the sour radish inside does not feel as delicious as the south gate, and the wide noodles are still as delicious as ever."
3952,22,\\n新店的环境很好，古色古香的，就是我们去的时候旁边一桌阿姨们特别吵。。。,"\\nThe environment of the new store is very good, antique, that is, when we went, the aunts at the table next to it were particularly noisy. ."
3952,23,\\n点了222的东西，最后付了差不多150，四个人还是很合算的，菜点多了，涮菜吃了一半不到。,". \\n ordered 222 things, and finally paid almost 150, four people are still very cost-effective, there are too many dishes, and less than half of the shabu is eaten."
17600,0,头回去，不清楚状况，11点半到只有一个地方还空着，被吧台小哥拦下说没地方，想着是等他给个号，结果人家忙着对个服务员狂骂，好几桌人都在看，素质好差…,"Head back, I don't know the situation, 11:30 to only one place is still empty, was stopped by the bar guy and said there is no place, thinking that he is waiting for him to give a number, but people are busy scolding a waiter, several tables are watching, the quality is so poor..."
17600,1,最后我说那里有个空位，小哥很不爽的让我去问临桌…,"In the end, I said that there was a vacant seat there, and the little brother was very unhappy and asked me to ask the table..."
17600,2,只想说海鲜年糕火锅很差，我们都没选择团购，店里说这款特价78，比团购多一点料，除了海虹和花蛤，基本就是在捞年糕和白菜…,"I just want to say that the seafood rice cake hot pot is very poor, we didn't choose group buying, the store said that this special price is 78, a little more than group buying, except for Haihong and clams, basically fishing rice cakes and cabbage..."
17600,3,图册里的芝士只是图册。,The cheese in the catalogue is just an atlas.
17600,4,还不如火炉火。,It's better than a stove fire.
17600,5,服务员很差，问几个问题都不知道，来回来去的等他去问，点了活章鱼和面包蟹，都快吃完了一问居然没下过单…,"The waiter is very poor, I don't know how many questions I asked, I waited for him to ask, ordered live octopus and brown crab, and I almost finished eating and asked that I hadn't placed an"
17600,6,如果喜欢吃海鲜，这里相对便宜，但千万别点年糕锅。,"order... If you like seafood, it's relatively cheap, but don't order the rice cake pot."
7199,0,位置：在号称铁西区最高端大气的综合体万象汇的五楼，交通方便。,"Location: On the fifth floor of Vientiane City, which is known as the most high-end complex in Tiexi District, with convenient transportation."
7199,1,环境：是现在最流行的loft加绿植的风格，还有很多油画和摄影作品，确实是很文艺范很清新的环境。,"Environment: It is the most popular style of loft and green plants, and there are many oil paintings and photographic works, which is indeed a very literary and fresh environment."
7199,2,菜品：第一发：招牌碳烤牛排，应该是没有腌制过的牛肉，比较有嚼劲，汁水很足，不过喜欢滑嫩口感的人可能会失望。,"Dishes: First shot: The signature charcoal grilled steak is supposed to be unmarinated beef, which is more chewy and juicy, but those who like a smooth and tender taste may be"
7199,3,第二发：鲜虾茄汁意面和黑胡椒牛肉意面，意面有弹性，比较地道，不像一些中式西餐厅的那种软塌塌的，食材新鲜。,"disappointed. Second shot: Shrimp tomato sauce pasta and black pepper beef pasta, the pasta is elastic and more authentic, unlike some Chinese Western restaurants, which are soft and collapsed, and the"
7199,4,第三发：墨西哥牛肉奶酪饼，这道菜值得强力推荐，奶酪和牛肉，配上墨西哥口味的面饼，口感微辣，十分好吃！！,"ingredients are fresh. 3rd shot: Mexican beef cheese pie, this dish is highly recommended, cheese and beef, with Mexican-style pasta, slightly"
7199,5,价格：用了大众点评的满百减十二，最后消费232元，两个人吃的很饱。,"spicy, very delicious!! Price: I used Dianping's full 100 minus 12, and finally consumed 232 yuan, and the"
7199,6,服务：不得不说服务实在是太好了，典型的南方式的细致和周到。,"two people ate very much. Service: I have to say that the service is really good, typical of the southern way of"
7199,7,总体来说是一家比较正宗的西餐厅，很值得再去。,"meticulous and thoughtful.  Overall, it is a more authentic western restaurant, and it is worth going again."
29968,0,点的是400的自助。,The order is a 400 buffet.
29968,1,所以有小青龙，这个是确实好吃。,"So there is a little green dragon, this is really delicious."
29968,2,但是限量每人半分。,"However, it is limited to half a cent per person."
29968,3,点了很多菜图片没有一一上传。,I ordered a lot of dishes and pictures were not uploaded one by one.
29968,4,总体来说每个菜都很新鲜，海胆不限量，很好吃，吃了很多！,"Overall every dish was fresh, the sea urchin was unlimited, it was delicious, and I ate a lot!"
29968,5,除了刺身以外铁板烧味道也不错。,"In addition to sashimi, teppanyaki also tastes good."
29968,6,羊排有点老，羊肉串说没有了，生蚝也说没了。,"The lamb chops are a bit old, the lamb skewers are said to be gone, and the oysters are also said to be gone."
29968,7,服务态度一般般，本来说光盘有优惠最后结账走找了个理由说不能给优惠了，我们据理力争后又给我们优惠了，非常搞。,"The service attitude is general.,Originally, the disc had a discount, and finally the checkout went to find a reason to say that it could not give a discount.,We gave us a discount after arguing.,Very engaged."
29968,8,除了这一点，试一次很开心的用餐。,"In addition to this, try a very happy meal."
29968,9,说实话还能吃，但是11点吃到1点多的时候就停止下单了。,"To be honest, I can still eat it, but I stopped ordering it when I ate it at 11 o'clock and 1"
29968,10,我还想吃几个提拉米苏,o'clock. I would also like to eat a few tiramisu
29103,0,毛家时尚餐厅位于十里大楼庐山区人民医院旁边，正对面就是九江银行，交通很便利，坐公交101.105路到庐山区人民医院下车，如果开车前往的话可以把车停在十里华府小区内，一个半小时之内是免费的，需要到毛家时尚餐厅前台领停车券。,"Mao's fashion restaurant is located next to Lushan District People's Hospital in Shili Building, directly opposite Jiujiang Bank, the transportation is very convenient, take bus 101.105 to Lushan District People's Hospital and get off, if you drive to it, you can park the car in Shili Huafu Community, it is free within an hour and a half, you need to go to the front desk of Mao's fashion restaurant to get a parking ticket."
29103,1,\\n\\n今天是和朋友一起过来聚餐的，六个大人三个小孩，团购了一个四到六人套餐，价格只要113元，而且菜品非常的多，有香辣片片鱼，海皇干捞粉丝煲，韭香鸡蛋锅，井冈山烟笋，香辣串串兔，油淋时蔬，银鱼紫菜肉丸汤，玉米粗粮汁，果盘，泡萝卜，香菜花生米。,"\\n\\n Today is with friends to come to dinner, six adults and three children, the group bought a package of four to six people, the price is only 113 yuan, and the dishes are very many, there are spicy slices of fish, Sea Emperor dry fishing vermicelli pot, leek egg pot, Jinggangshan smoked bamboo shoots, spicy skewer rabbit, oily vegetables, whitebait seaweed meatball soup, corn coarse grain juice, fruit plate, pickled radish, coriander peanuts."
29103,2,真的非常划算，大家吃得非常饱。,"It's really cost-effective, and everyone is very full."
29103,3,现在在外面六个大人加三个小随便便吃个饭估计都要两三百吧，他这里团购只要一百多，真心的不错。,"Now it is estimated that it will cost two or three hundred for six adults and three children to eat casually outside, and he only needs more than a hundred for group purchases here, which is really good."
29103,4,总得来说感觉猜的口味还可以，就是鱼烧的不是很入味，井冈山烟笋还是挺好吃的，笋子非常的嫩。,"In general, I feel that the taste of guessing is okay, but the fish is not very delicious, and the smoked bamboo shoots in Jinggangshan are still very delicious, and the bamboo shoots are very"
29103,5,韭香鸡蛋锅这道菜适合小朋友吃，不辣，吃起来非常的香。,"tender. The leek egg pot is a dish suitable for children, it is not spicy, and it tastes very fragrant."
34130,0,经历了门店合同到期，选址，装潢等一系列的折腾，LISA的店终于在离我家距离比较近的地方重新开张了，新店的环境明显比老店更好，无论是采光还是地理位置，都更易于描述，虽然不再是沙发座，简洁的布置，简单的座椅，还可以拼桌在店内过生日，更可以自由发挥在蛋糕上写上祝福的话语。,"After a series of tosses such as the expiration of the store contract, site selection, decoration, etc., LISA's store finally reopened in a place closer to my home, the environment of the new store is obviously better than the old store, whether it is lighting or geographical location, it is easier to describe, although it is no longer a sofa seat, simple layout, simple seats, you can also share a table in the store for your birthday, and you can freely play on the cake to write blessings."
34130,1,最近店内活动的蛋糕更是好吃的不要不要的，芒果蛋糕不是普通的芒果颗粒的蛋糕，更是融合了提拉米苏的口感，还有榴莲的夹层，一口下去多种的回味，过生日的时候订个蛋糕来这里吧，还可以来找美女老板娘聊天哦。,"The cake of the recent in-store event is even more delicious, don't want it, the mango cake is not an ordinary mango grain cake, but also a fusion of the taste of tiramisu, as well as the sandwich of durian, a variety of aftertaste, order a cake here for your birthday, and you can also come to chat with the beautiful hostess."
43122,0,不得不给五星！,Had to give five stars!
43122,1,五十团了一百代金券，半价真是太划算了。,"Fifty regiments have a hundred vouchers, and half price is really a bargain."
43122,2,特别推荐烤羊排，真是美味啊，分量很足，手拿一根根羊排大口大口吃肉的感觉真好，羊排肥瘦相宜，闻起来香喷喷，吃起来很香甜，有点肥肉的最好吃，肥而不腻，也很入味，如果烤久一点，里面的肉没那么硬就完美了。,"Grilled lamb chops are especially recommended, it is really delicious, the portion is very sufficient, it feels good to take a lamb chop and eat meat in a big mouthful, the lamb chops are fat and thin, they smell fragrant, they taste very sweet, the best ones with a little fat, fat but not greasy, and they are also very flavorful, if they are roasted for a long time, the meat inside is not so hard and perfect."
43122,3,推荐点羊排、羊排串、羊肉串，肥牛感觉味道比预期差一点，至于鸡翅等其它肉类分量有点少，烤蔬菜类则调料太多味太浓。,"It is recommended to order lamb chops, lamb chop skewers, and lamb skewers, the fat cow feels that the taste is a little worse than expected, as for the chicken wings and other meats, the amount is a little less, and the grilled vegetables have too many seasonings and too strong flavor."
43122,4,这里吃烧烤有个好处是没有油烟，厨房烤好送来，而且是煤气烤的不像木炭会上火。,"One of the advantages of eating barbecue here is that there is no oil smoke, the kitchen is grilled and delivered, and it is gas-grilled, unlike"
43122,5,给店家提个建议，烤鱼鱿鱼不能用代金券没必要，这些不是什么海鲜。,"charcoal. A suggestion to the store, grilled fish and squid can't be used with vouchers is not necessary, these are not seafood."
35472,0,菜品还可以吧，不难吃。,"The dishes are okay, not unpalatable."
35472,1,但是服务员的态度让我好惊呆！,But the waiter's attitude stunned me!
35472,2,我们十月二号去的，不知道是假期店长放假吧，服务员相当散漫的到处溜达着，让我们有老人不能喝甜的只能喝水，我要了杯水，滚烫的水拿了个有把手的饮料杯，我觉得挺好，结果过了一会来另外一个服务员说有把手的杯子只能盛饮料，然后给了一个没有把手的玻璃杯，我说这个没有把手这么烫的水怎么拿呀。,"We went on October 2nd, I don't know if it's a holiday store manager on holiday, the waiter is quite casual wandering around, so that we have the old people can not drink sweet can only drink water, I asked for a glass of water, hot water took a drink cup with a handle, I think it's good, but after a while another waiter said that the cup with a handle can only hold drinks, and then gave a glass without a handle, I said how to take this water that is so hot without a handle."
35472,3,服务员啥都没解释直接拿走我手里的水倒进了玻璃杯放桌子上就走了！,"The waiter didn't explain anything, just took the water in my hand, poured it into a glass, put it on the table and left!"
35472,4,过了一会点的豆花上来了，一桶豆花配的酱料很少一碟，我们问能不能加酱料，一个男服务员想都没想的来了一句不能，甩头就走了。。,"After a while, the bean curd came up, a bucket of bean curd with very little sauce, we asked if we could add sauce, a male waiter didn't think about it, he couldn't, shook his head and left."
35472,5,要是忙敷衍一下也就算了，客人还没有服务员多呢！,"If you are busy with perfunctory, forget it, there are not as many guests as waiters!"
35472,6,结账的时候点评买单，我们找到一个叫九宫格的火锅店，问是不是他家，因为他家也有九宫格火锅，服务员说是后我们就买单了。,"When we checked out, we found a hot pot restaurant called Jiugongge, and asked if it was his house, because his house also had Jiugongge hot pot, and the waiter said that we would pay after that."
35472,7,结果不是他家是同一栋楼的另外一家店，自己家店都不认识啊！,"It turned out that his house was another store in the same building, and he didn't know his own store!"
35472,8,害得我们去找那家店去退钱麻烦死了。,It hurt us to go to the store to get the money back.
35472,9,总之以后不会来了，这种店再好吃也不来何况没好吃到哪里去啊！,"In short, it won't come in the future, no matter how delicious this kind of shop is, it won't come, let alone if it's not"
35472,10,怪不得味道一般的海底捞生意好呢！,delicious! No wonder the average taste of Haidilao business is good!
31051,0,甜品店位于外贸路中段的山西老面王对面，招牌不大，关键有树给遮挡住了，不注意真不好找呢，店内空间不大，外面没有停车位，但可以停小电驴。。,"The dessert shop is located in the middle of the foreign trade road opposite the old noodle king in Shanxi, the signboard is not big, the key is covered by a tree, it is really hard to find it if you don't pay attention, the space in the store is not large, there is no parking space outside, but you can stop the small electric donkey."
31051,1,环境上比较干净，今天赶上闪惠满减25的优惠活动，划算到不要不要的。,"The environment is relatively clean, and today I caught up with the discount of 25 for the flash discount, which is so cost-effective that you don't want it."
31051,2,首先说说我点的几样。。,"First of all, let's talk about a few things I ordered."
31051,3,因为看见有榴莲炒冰马上就决定来着试试的！,"Because I saw durian fried ice, I immediately decided to try it!"
31051,4,第一感觉吧，价格上25一份榴莲炒冰如果不是活动价格买的，真的太贵了，其次味道上真的不是很浓郁，比较淡，说真的，即便活动价格还是觉得很不值。,"The first feeling is that the price is 25 if you don't buy a durian fried ice at the event price, it's really too expensive, and secondly, the taste is really not very strong, it's relatively light, to be honest, even if the event price is still very worthless."
31051,5,要了火龙果汁8元，加了水跟糖，比较清甜。,"I asked for dragon juice for 8 yuan, and I added water and sugar, which was sweeter."
31051,6,椰奶清补凉8元，配料倒是很多，但味道感觉比较一般，还是一馨甜品家比较合我口味。,"Coconut milk is 8 yuan, there are a lot of ingredients, but the taste feels more general, or a sweet dessert is more suitable for my taste."
31051,7,最后要了加牛奶的火龙果+芒果超炒冰12元，味道搭配很惊艳！,"In the end, I asked for dragon fruit + mango super fried ice with milk for 12 yuan, and the taste match was amazing!"
31051,8,这个推荐大家尝试。。。,I recommend everyone to try
31051,9,炒冰的话总体售价我觉得不活动还是偏小贵的。。。,"this... If you fry ice, the overall price I think is inactive or a little expensive.。。。"
34218,0,经常来楚太子这家在鲁磨路的店，店面够大，店里面还算宽敞，上菜速度也很快，团购券可以点菜也可以点烧烤，用着也很方便。,"I often come to Prince Chu's shop on Lumo Road, the store is big enough, the store is quite spacious, the serving speed is also very fast, and the group purchase coupon can be ordered or barbecued, which is also very convenient to use."
34218,1,烧烤最近稍微涨了点价，肉串算是同等价位里面比较大的，烤得也比较嫩，就是吃起来稍微感觉有点油，可能腌肉的时候加了油拌过了吧。,"The price of barbecue has risen a little recently, and the meat skewers are relatively large in the same price range, and the grill is relatively tender, but it feels a little oily to eat, and it may have been mixed with oil when marinating the meat."
34218,2,烤土豆片和烤鸡爪都蛮好吃的，鸡爪卤过的，比较软烂入味，稍微烤下之后带点烧烤的味道很不错。,"Baked potato chips and grilled chicken feet are quite delicious, the chicken feet are marinated, relatively soft and rotten, and the taste of barbecue is very good after a little roasting."
34218,3,买券的时候有大牌立减的活动叠加很划算。,"When you buy a coupon, there is a superposition of activities with big names and instant discounts, which is very cost-effective."
34218,4,屯了几张慢慢吃～！,Eat a few
34218,5,服务稍微差点，晚上9点以后去基本一楼就一到两个服务员点单，经常叫叫了半天她才来。,"slowly~! The service is slightly worse, after 9 o'clock in the evening to the basic first floor on one or two waiters ordered, often called for a long time before she came."
16659,0,地理位置：珠江新城高德置地冬广场，其实大体还是很好找的，交通也很便利，就是有点绕不熟悉的朋友可能会走错路。,"Location: Zhujiang New Town Gaode Land Winter Plaza, in fact, it is generally easy to find, and the transportation is also very convenient, but a little unfamiliar friends may go the wrong way."
16659,1,我就是一个，哈哈。,"I'm one, haha."
16659,2,\\n环境：店面不大，但是装修得还算别致，嫣然一种高级西餐厅的感觉，但是又不会让人觉得庄重，反而有点浪漫中的小温馨，这种气氛我还是挺喜欢的。,"\\nEnvironment: The store is not big, but the decoration is quite chic, Yanran is a high-end western restaurant feeling, but it will not make people feel solemn, but a little romantic in the small warmth, this atmosphere I still like."
16659,3,\\n出品：用心的选料和精致的出品让我爱上了它，Mr.鱼的用心还是可以感受得到的。,"\\nProduction: The careful selection of materials and exquisite production made me fall in love with it, and Mr. Fish's intentions can still be felt."
16659,4,\\n店内放题30多种海鲜刺身、铁板烧以及其他料理不限量供应，食材足够新鲜，制作摆盘精致，口味特别棒！,"There are more than 30 kinds of seafood sashimi, teppanyaki and other dishes in the store, which are available in unlimited quantities, and the ingredients are fresh enough, the preparation and presentation are exquisite, and the taste is particularly good!"
16659,5,\\n首推鹅肝和鳌虾，非常美味。,"\\nThe foie gras and crayfish are the first to be recommended, which are very delicious."
16659,6,\\n❁板烧鹅肝虽然卖相比较一般，但是鹅肝的香味真的是无法阻挡，差点把舌头都吞掉了，配上一口红酒真的是一种美味的享受，个人钟爱。,"\\n❁Although the roasted foie gras is relatively average, the aroma of foie gras is really unstoppable, almost swallowing the tongue, with a sip of red wine is really a delicious enjoyment, personal favorite."
16659,7,\\n❁鳌虾虽然个头不大，但是口感很爽口，味道出奇甜美。,"\\n❁Although the shrimp is not big, the taste is very refreshing and the taste is surprisingly sweet."
16659,8,大爱！,Great love!
16659,9,\\n❁红酒冻鹅肝，非常特别，用红酒浸泡过后而制成的，口感特别，吃起来很像巧克力，味道也很独特新奇，值得尝试一番。,"\\n❁Red wine frozen foie gras, very special, made after soaking in red wine, the taste is special, it tastes like chocolate, the taste is also unique and novel, it is worth trying."
16659,10,\\n❁和牛刺身和小青龙龙虾刺身味道也很棒，但是生蚝虽然肥美，但是真的特别地腥，小伙伴们都无法接受。,"\\n❁Wagyu beef sashimi and small green lobster sashimi also taste great, but although the oysters are fat, they are really fishy, and the friends can't accept them."
16659,11,慎点。,Be cautious.
16659,12,\\n❁海胆刺身虽然个头小但是很香甜，三文鱼刺身、螺肉、北极贝等普通的刺身都是很新鲜的。,"Although the sea urchin sashimi is small but very sweet, ordinary sashimi such as salmon sashimi, snail meat, and arctic shellfish are very fresh."
16659,13,\\n❁牛舌、牛扒选料和手艺都很棒！,"\\n❁The beef tongue, steak selection and craftsmanship are all great!"
16659,14,可以试试看喔。,You can give it a try.
16659,15,\\n❁浓郁日本梅子酒是我的最爱，配上海鲜刚刚好。,"\\n❁ Rich Japanese plum wine is my favorite, and it goes just fine with seafood."
16659,16,红酒也是很不错的，入口醇香，与海鲜熟食配搭也是在合适不过了！,"The red wine is also very good, mellow in the mouth, and it is also suitable to pair with seafood delicatessen!"
16659,17,希望下次可以有机会尝试其他酒款。,I hope to have the opportunity to try other wines next time.
16659,18,\\n❁甜品略少，希望可以多增加多一些蛋糕甜品就perfect了。,"\\n❁There are slightly fewer desserts, I hope you can add more cakes and desserts to be perfect."
16659,19,不过焦糖炖蛋真的做得很好吃，焦糖香而不焦，甜而不腻，值得一试。,"However, the caramel egg stew is really delicious, the caramel is fragrant but not burnt, sweet but not greasy, and it is worth a try."
16659,20,燕窝雪糕同样不要错过，哈根达斯的雪糕底再加上燕窝，特别的搭配，个人觉得草莓或香草味的该会更好，巧克力味的味道太浓会掩盖燕窝的口感和味道。,"Bird's nest ice cream is also not to be missed, Häagen-Dazs ice cream base plus bird's nest, special matching, I personally think strawberry or vanilla flavor should be better, chocolate flavor is too strong will mask the texture and taste of bird's nest."
16659,21,杨枝甘露没试到，太饱了，希望下次有机会试试。,"I haven't tried the poplar manna, I'm too full, I hope to have a chance to try it next time."
16659,22,\\n说实话价格尤贵，但是性价比还可以，因为食材新鲜，还是能吃回这个价的。,"\\nTo be honest, the price is very expensive, but the cost performance is okay, because the ingredients are fresh, and you can still eat back at this price."
16659,23,不考虑价格预算的话，确实是很值得推荐的。,"If you don't consider the price budget, it is indeed highly recommended."
16659,24,如果有其他更丰富的出品的话相信会更加地出色的。,"If there are other more abundant products, I believe it will be even better."
16659,25,\\n希望新的一年Mr.鱼更多更好的出品，值得期待。,"\\nI hope that in the new year, Mr. fish will produce more and better products, which is worth looking forward to."
16659,26,[爱心]✧*｡,[Love]✧*.
16659,27,٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧*｡,٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧*｡
47080,0,这个地段真的是绝了，排队要好久啊，性价比很高，以前不知道有这样一个店，是一次到杭州玩的时候出租车师傅推荐了西湖边银泰城的新白鹿，说这里的菜不错，口味正宗，当时就去了，两个人次了160不到吧，点多了，没吃完，不得不说性价比相当高，回上海后就搜了一下，居然上海也有，就去次了，味道也都差不多，主要是老婆喜欢吃，,"This lot is really absolute, the queue is a long time, the cost performance is very high, I didn't know that there was such a shop before, it was a time to play in Hangzhou when the taxi master recommended the new white deer of Intime City by the West Lake, saying that the dishes here are good, the taste is authentic, I went at that time, two people were less than 160 times, I ordered more, I didn't finish eating, I have to say that the cost performance is quite high, I searched it after returning to Shanghai, and there was actually Shanghai, I went to the time, and the taste was almost the same, mainly because my wife likes to eat,"
47080,1,但我作为土生土长的四川汉子吃这种酸甜的东西，还真是不太喜欢。,"But as a native of Sichuan, I really don't like this sweet and sour"
47080,2,但老婆说这就是杭帮菜的正宗口味，所以在此我还是推荐给大家。,"thing. But my wife said that this is the authentic taste of Hangzhou cuisine, so I still recommend it to everyone."
41137,0,难得这家店不排队，和老公过来解决晚饭，这家店感觉从进店开始能自助都是自助的，自己对着号牌找到位子，自己倒水。,"It's rare that this store doesn't line up, and my husband came to solve dinner, and this store feels that it can be self-help from the beginning of entering the store, and I find a seat on the number plate and pour water by myself."
41137,1,想点菜，服务员叫我们自己上微信点，好吧……,"I wanted to order, and the waiter asked us to order it on WeChat, okay......"
41137,2,可点完居然收不到验证码，看看别桌都是用纸质菜单点的，没办法只能再叫服务员，早这样还不如一开始就让我们直接点菜呢，浪费时间。,"But I can't receive the verification code after ordering, and look at the other tables are ordered with paper menus, and I have no choice but to call the waiter, so it's better to let us order directly at the beginning, wasting time."
41137,3,\\n\\n上菜速度极其慢，下单后先上了个川北凉粉，然后就是无尽的等，差不多等了要半小时吧，其他的菜才慢慢上来。,"\\n\\nThe speed of serving is extremely slow, after placing an order, I first put on a northern Sichuan jelly, and then it is endless, and it takes half an hour to wait, and the other dishes will come up slowly."
41137,4,\\n\\n这里的菜口味感觉没以前好了，普遍都不辣，口水鲶鱼的鱼片很薄，没什么鲜味，牛肉豆花很淡，猪蹄都是老公吃的，不做评价，鸭血＋午餐肉的冒菜算是味道最好的一个了吧，但是量少。,"\\n\\nThe taste of the dishes here is not as good as before, it is generally not spicy, the fillet of saliva catfish is very thin, there is no umami, the beef bean curd is very light, the pig's trotters are eaten by the husband, no evaluation, the duck blood + luncheon meat is the best taste, but the amount is"
41137,5,最后两个人吃了136块，估计价格便宜是唯一的优势了。,"small. In the end, the two people ate 136 yuan, and it is estimated that the price is cheap is the only advantage."
37066,0,跟闺蜜来大卫城选来选去来到这家餐厅，感觉生意不错，饭点几乎上座率90%，为什么不是满座就是因为现在经济不景气，这家店价格比较高吧。,"I came to David City with my girlfriends to choose to come to this restaurant, I feel that the business is good, and the attendance rate of the meal is almost 90%, why is it not full or because of the current economic recession, the price of this store is relatively high."
37066,1,但是整个就餐感觉不错，我还发现了我很喜欢吃的东西！,"But the whole meal felt good, and I also found something I liked to eat!"
37066,2,\\n菜品：【墨西哥炒饭】是我的主餐，个人感觉吃前半份的时候挺好吃但是后半份的时候就感觉吃不下了，很少剩饭的我剩下了。,"\\nDish: [Mexican fried rice] is my main meal, I personally feel that the first half of the meal is very delicious, but the second half of the meal feels like I can't eat, and I have very little leftovers."
37066,3,【牛油果沙拉】闻起来好赞，吃起来也不错，就是价格挺贵的！,"【Avocado Salad】It smells so good, and it tastes good, but the price is quite expensive!"
37066,4,【祖母薄饼披萨】我的大爱啊！,【Grandmother's Pizza】My great love!
37066,5,太好吃了有木有！,It's so delicious!
37066,6,狂甩必胜客N条街啊有木有！,"Dump Pizza Hut N streets, there is wood!"
37066,7,【烤土豆皮】这是看了点评推荐点的，真心不好吃！,"【Baked potato skin】This is recommended by reading the review, it is really not delicious!"
37066,8,腻死了！,I'm tired of it!
37066,9,竟然裹面多油腻啊……,How greasy is the dough......
37066,10,受不了！,Stand!
37066,11,所以说口味这东西真是看个人了！,So the taste of this thing really depends on the individual!
37066,12,\\n环境：哇～真不错！,\\nEnvironment: Wow~ That's good!
37066,13,喜欢的感觉！,Loved the feeling!
37066,14,很舒服有格调但是不至于感觉厚重沉闷。,"It's very comfortable and stylish, but it doesn't feel heavy and dull."
37066,15,\\n服务：挺好的，安安静静，有需要召唤来比较快速响应就行。,"\\nService: Very good, quiet, if you need to summon to respond"
37066,16,\\n推荐菜：祖母薄饼披萨\\n人均：100\\n个人感觉吃多了中餐偶尔换换口味感觉还是挺好的钱！,"quickly. \\nRecommended dishes: Grandmother's pizza and pizza\\nPer capita: 100\\nI feel that I have eaten too much Chinese food, and I feel that it is still good money to change the taste occasionally!"
7935,0,作为日料是绝对不合格！,It is absolutely unqualified as a Japanese food!
7935,1,第一，服务差！,"First, poor service!"
7935,2,卫生间单间里没有纸巾，把纸巾隔到外头，这是任何一间日料都不会做的事情。,"There are no paper towels in the bathroom room, so keeping the paper towels out is something that no Japanese restaurant does."
7935,3,其次，上桌后没有提供毛巾，五个人只提供一份两块南瓜的前菜！,"Secondly, no towels were provided after serving, and only one appetizer with two pieces of pumpkin was provided for the five people!"
7935,4,五个人够吃吗？,Is it enough for five people?
7935,5,再次，缺日本酒。,"Again, there is a shortage of sake."
7935,6,连天妇罗都没有。,Not even tempura.
7935,7,叫了一份春花鱼，煎出来的，非常腥，吃了一口后根本下不了筷子！,"I ordered a spring flower fish, fried out, very fishy, I couldn't get off the chopsticks after eating a bite!"
7935,8,后投诉，送了一碟小菜。,"After complaining, a dish of side dishes was delivered."
7935,9,鱼生之类的比起别家也好不到哪里去，而且价钱尤其贵。,"Yusheng and the like are not much better than others, and the price is especially expensive."
7935,10,吃饭的时候二楼一群服务员在包厢外手机。,"During the meal, a group of waiters on the second floor were on their mobile phones outside the"
7935,11,无论哪一点都称不上日料。,box. None of them can be called Japanese food.
4258,0,之前看到微信推广过，心心念念图个新鲜，一直想拔草的，一直忘记，终于成行了。,"I saw WeChat promotion before, and I thought about it freshly, and I always wanted to pull weeds, but I forgot it, and finally made it."
4258,1,和朋友们约新世界看电影，这家在雅居乐的一楼，，正好过来体验一下。,"Ask friends to watch a movie in New World, this is on the first floor of Agile, just come and experience it."
4258,2,一进门就看到一排机器，没想到现在吃个汉堡都能那么高端。,"As soon as I entered the door, I saw a row of machines, and I didn't expect that a burger would be so high-end now."
4258,3,地方其实是有点小的，装修和其他麦当劳还是有点区别的，有一张桌子竟然还是自己可以发亮的，而且手触它会变颜色，正好两个人可以下五子棋。,"The place is actually a bit small, the decoration is still a little different from other McDonald's, there is a table that can still shine by itself, and it will change color when you touch it, just two people can play backgammon."
4258,4,开始自助点餐，面包有三种，有圆的，甜的，直接包生菜吃起来应该不方便，于是选了经典欧式面包，肉饼只有牛肉的，这个不大好，选择太少了，我一开始还不相信只有一种选择，还找了半天看有没有其他选择。,"Started to order buffet, there are three kinds of bread, round, sweet, it should be inconvenient to eat lettuce directly, so I chose the classic European bread, the meatloaf is only beef, this is not very good, there are too few choices, I didn't believe that there was only one choice at first, and I looked for a long time to see if there were any other options."
4258,5,蔬菜要了番茄，生菜，芝士选了保守的平时最常见的黄切达，觉得黄色更配牛肉。,"I asked for tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese for the conservative yellow cheddar, which is usually the most common, and I think yellow is more suitable for beef."
4258,6,酱料选了加钱的牛油果酱，很不错，还有免费的蛋黄酱和番茄酱。,"The sauce was made with guacamole with extra money, which was nice, and there was free mayonnaise and ketchup."
4258,7,最后加了个煎鸡蛋，4块钱，就是猪柳蛋堡里那种，完成！,"Finally, I added a fried egg, 4 yuan, which is the kind in the pork fillet egg burger, and it's done!"
4258,8,总共63块！！,63 pieces in total!!
4258,9,贵啊！,Expensive!
4258,10,点完拿着“小飞碟”去坐着了，过了好一会儿店员就拿过来了。。。,"After ordering, I took the ""little flying saucer"" to sit.,After a while, the clerk brought it over.。。。"
4258,11,所以震动盘提示有点鸡肋，店员直接送餐，都无需自取。,"Therefore, the vibrating plate prompt is a bit chicken, and the clerk delivers the food directly, and there is no need to pick it up."
4258,12,薯条换了个小钢丝容器凹造型，是细的那种，一套吃完，竟然撑到了，薯条最后都没吃完。,"The fries were replaced with a small wire container concave shape, which was the thin kind, and after eating one set, it actually lasted until the fries were not eaten in the end."
4258,13,自己DIY的感觉还是比量产的套餐要好吃。,The feeling of DIY is still better than the mass-produced set meal.
4258,14,不过朋友点的其他两个汉堡，一个少放了生番茄，一个少了一个肉饼和培根，交涉了两次终于重新做了一个给我朋友。,"However, the other two burgers my friend ordered, one with less raw tomatoes, and the other with less meatloaf and bacon, negotiated twice and finally remade one for my"
4258,15,所以如果点DIY的汉堡，汉堡端上来之后最好自己先看一下，核对一下是否东西齐全,"friend. So if you order a DIY burger, it's best to take a look at it yourself after the burger is served and check if it's complete"
15029,0,在北苑路北地铁站旁边的卜蜂莲花超市的底店，位置还是比较好找的，店分上下两层，空间很大，座位数目也不少，只是一楼的冷气坏掉了，这么大热天儿的环境的确很难熬。,"The bottom store of the C.P. Lotus supermarket next to the North Metro Station of Beiyuan Road, the location is still relatively easy to find, the store is divided into two floors, the space is very large, and the number of seats is also a lot, but the air conditioner on the first floor is broken, and the environment is really difficult to endure on such a hot day."
15029,1,\\n产品的种类不算多，几种肉夹馍豆花酸辣粉儿，我们去的时候凉皮经卖完了，有些遗憾。,"\\nThere are not many types of products, several kinds of meat and steamed bean curd hot and sour noodles, when we went, the Liangpi Sutra was sold out, and it was a pity."
15029,2,肉夹馍的饼皮很薄，但很酥脆，的肉量也不小肉的香味也很浓郁，夹牛肉的肉夹馍里面肉质也很好，可以看出是非常好的瘦肉不会有其他皮筋等不好的部位。,"The crust of the meat sandwich bun is very thin, but it is very crispy, the amount of meat is not small, the aroma of the meat is also very strong, and the meat quality in the meat sandwich bun with beef is also very good, and it can be seen that it is very good lean meat, and there will be no other bad parts such as skin bands."
15029,3,\\n豆花的味道也不错，酸爽的浇卤里面还有黄豆粒和榨菜末丰富口感，夏天喝很开胃。,"\\nThe taste of the bean curd is also good, and the sour and refreshing marinade has a rich taste of soybean grains and minced mustard, which is very appetizing to drink in summer."
15029,4,\\n甑糕是新鲜出炉的，里面枣和豆子配料很丰富，也不会太甜腻，不错。,"The cake is freshly baked, and the dates and beans are rich in ingredients, and it is not too sweet and greasy, which is"
15029,5,\\n整体价格偏贵，但味道还是不错的。,"good. \\nThe overall price is on the expensive side, but the taste is still good."
1348,0,一直想吃日料，可惜就是太贵了，之前朋友吃过水林间，说还不错，但是吃的是虹悦城那边的，没有日料，但是其他肉很不错，于是妥妥的选了紫峰这家，虽然贵了一点可是有刺身啊，看到大众点评上有减30的活动，更是心动，可是买的时候才发现得是最新版才能，等我升级完，居然已经卖完了，太火爆了，没办法想吃啊，还是原价买了！,"I've always wanted to eat Japanese food, but it's a pity that it's too expensive, before my friend ate the water forest, said it was good, but the food was Hongyue City, there was no Japanese food, but the other meat was very good, so I properly chose Zifeng's house, although it was a little more expensive, but there was sashimi, and I saw the activities of minus 30 on the public reviews, and I was even more excited, but when I bought it, I found out that it was the latest version of the talent, and when I finished upgrading, it was actually sold out, it was too hot, I couldn't think of eating, or bought it at the original price!"
1348,1,提前预约的位置，5点去得，已经有的人在外面排队了。,"The location of the reservation in advance, go at 5 o'clock, and there are already people queuing outside."
1348,2,很快我们进去后，服务员就开始给我们介绍，全程是蹲着的，服务态度也太好了。,"Soon after we went in, the waiter began to introduce us, the whole process was squatting, and the service attitude was too good."
1348,3,吃的寿喜锅和味增的鸳鸯。,Suki pot and miso mandarin duck to eat.
1348,4,寿喜锅沾鸡蛋液很赞。,Suki nabe dipped in egg liquid is fabulous.
1348,5,只可惜吃太多了会腻。,It's a pity that you will get tired of eating too much.
1348,6,后面吃另一个锅多，肉肉先上了六盘…,"Eat another pot more later, and the meat is served on six plates first..."
1348,7,印象中黑色盘子的是雪花牛，白色是低脂牛，蓝色是羔羊肉还有红色盘子好像是猪里脊。,"The black plate is snowflake beef, the white plate is low-fat beef, the blue plate is lamb and the red plate looks like pork tenderloin."
1348,8,最好吃的感觉死雪花和猪肉。,Best to eat the feeling of dead snowflakes and pork.
1348,9,刺身也不错！,Sashimi is also good!
1348,10,饮料我们主要喝的可尔必思，喜欢那种乳酸菌饮料的味道。,"The drink we mainly drink is Calpis, and we like the taste of the lactic acid bacteria drink."
1348,11,还有些凉菜感觉一般般。,There are also some cold dishes that feel average.
1348,12,冰淇淋吃的奶油樱花的很赞。,The cream of the ice cream cherry blossoms eaten is fabulous.
1348,13,虽然,"Although there are not many dishes, they are all very realistic, and the food is really too"
1348,14,菜品不多，但都很实在，吃的真的太撑了。很满意,strong. Very satisfied
40804,0,长草挺久的一家店了，终于在上周六和小伙伴一起拔草。,"A shop that has been growing grass for a long time, and finally pulled the grass with my friends last Saturday."
40804,1,一进门就有一只虎皮喵扑到眼前来，哈哈哈，萌，我是一个猫狗双担的人，有猫有狗都喜欢。,"As soon as I entered the door, a tiger skin meow pounced in front of me, hahaha, cute, I am a person with two cats and dogs, and I like both cats and dogs."
40804,2,环境真心不错，比一般日料店感觉要宽敞，有点咖啡馆的意思，桌上有台灯，沙发挺舒服，手边就有电源插座，wifi密码也是萌得不要不要的（大家自己去看就知道）。,"The environment is really good, more spacious than the general Japanese restaurant, a bit of a café, there is a lamp on the table, the sofa is very comfortable, there is a power socket at hand, and the wifi password is also cute not to know (you can see it yourself)."
40804,3,出门时还发现某处贴着条座右铭：并肩而立才是真爱。,"When I went out, I also found a motto pasted somewhere: Standing side by side is true love."
40804,4,（大意）——这句我喜欢。,(Care) - I like this sentence.
40804,5,\\n招牌的芝士海鲜焗饭当然是要来一份的，谈不上惊艳，但确实值得一吃，拉丝不错饭入味，海鲜料不是太足，但都切得细碎易吃；,"\\nThe signature cheese seafood baked rice is of course to have a portion, not amazing, but it is really worth eating, the brushed rice is delicious, the seafood is not too much, but it is finely chopped and easy to eat;"
40804,6,金枪鱼沙拉量很足，点赞，味道新鲜爽口；,"The amount of tuna salad is very large, praised, and the taste is fresh and refreshing;"
40804,7,蒲烧鳗鱼比起那种资深日料店还是略有差距，不是很肥美，不过一般吃吃还可以，也算鲜甜；,"Kabayaki eel is still slightly behind that kind of senior Japanese restaurant, not very fatty, but it is generally okay to eat, and it is also fresh and sweet;"
40804,8,肥牛的具体菜名有点忘了，肥牛里面还卷了点什么，反正口味挺有层次感的，推荐；,"I forgot the specific name of the fat cow a little bit, and there was something rolled in the fat cow, anyway, the taste is quite layered, recommended;"
40804,9,咖喱龙虾寿司，不知道是不是因为冻得太冰，龙虾的Q弹质感和鲜甜度没充分展示出来，还不如出云寿司那种专做外送的；,"Curry lobster sushi, I don't know if it's because it's frozen too cold, the Q-elastic texture and freshness of the lobster are not fully displayed, and it's not as good as the Izumo sushi that specializes in delivery;"
40804,10,冻柠茶意外地不错。,Frozen lemon tea is unexpectedly
40804,11,\\n总之菜品上仍有进步空间，不过整个店给人感觉很舒服又有各种萌点，会再光顾哒~,"good. \\nIn short, there is still room for improvement in the dishes, but the whole store feels very comfortable and has a variety of cute points, and I will visit again~"
37185,0,过去吃也是因为朋友介绍，那去的人大部分都是朋友+朋友介绍，在三楼很不显眼的地方，所以必须做口碑的。,"In the past, I ate because of the introduction of friends, and most of the people who went there were friends + friends introduced, and it was a very inconspicuous place on the third floor, so it must be word-of-mouth."
37185,1,走进去一点不想麻辣烫哦，老板特别强调小清新，新鲜食材。,"I don't want to be spicy when I walk in, and the boss especially emphasizes the small freshness and fresh ingredients."
37185,2,我特别推荐里面的肥牛8元一份，真真实实的牛肉啊，外面肯定是吃不到的很大一份，特别新鲜！,"I especially recommend the fat beef inside for 8 yuan, the real beef, the outside must not be eaten a large portion, especially fresh!"
37185,3,然后那个宽粉太好吃了，我总共点了30元就撑死了，边上的女孩子都说吃不下了，但是最后都是吃个底朝天，里面那个微辣真的上面好多辣椒以为很辣的，其实还不错，那个花生有点干锅调料的感觉，想想外面干锅底料一份也得8-10元。。,"And then the wide noodles are so delicious, I ordered a total of 30 yuan to die, the girls on the side said they couldn't eat it, but in the end they all ate a bottom, the slightly spicy inside is really a lot of chili peppers thought it was very spicy, in fact, it's not bad, the peanuts are a little dry pot seasoning feeling, think about the outside dry pot base material also has to be 8-10"
37185,4,再说一下那个蔬菜，蔬菜都是当天蔬菜特别新鲜，每一份都是独立包装的，特别用心，包起来很累的人工肯定很厉害，哈哈 建议就是玩乐东西太单调了，感觉墙面可以刷一些可爱的图案，可以让女孩子拍照啊，然后是下午5点才营业，中间时间可以提供下午茶呀，哈哈，反正感觉跟去咖啡吧差不多，可以跟朋友聚会吃点甜品，只有麻辣烫太浪费喽,"yuan. Let's talk about that vegetable, the vegetables are all the vegetables of the day are particularly fresh, each one is individually packaged, especially attentive, the artificial packaging is very tired, it must be very powerful, haha The suggestion is that the fun things are too monotonous, I feel that the wall can be brushed with some cute patterns, and girls can take pictures, and then it is open at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and afternoon tea can be provided in the middle of the time, haha, anyway, it feels similar to going to the coffee bar, you can party with friends to eat some dessert, only Malatang is too wasteful"
23735,0,我直到去了这家总店才知道我家附近的那个金太阳是分店，不过分店为什么要叫旗舰店呢，让人费解啊。,"I didn't know that the Golden Sun near my house was a branch until I went to this main store, but why the branch was called a flagship store is puzzling."
23735,1,言归正传，又是一个加完班的夜晚，两个人实在是饿的不行不行了，想着就近吃一口然后唠唠工作上的事。,"To get back to the point, it was another night of overtime, and the two of them were really hungry, thinking about eating a bite nearby and chatting about work."
23735,2,\\n\\n位置，太原街夜市，都是烧烤店那里，把头。,"\\n\\n location, Taiyuan Street Night Market, are all barbecue restaurants there, the head."
23735,3,\\n\\n环境，这家店一看就是有年头了，一般般。,"\\n\\nEnvironment, this store looks like it's old, and it's average."
23735,4,\\n\\n服务，碰到了在家附近那个店的服务员，很亲切。,"\\n\\n service, met the waiter of the store near home, very kind."
23735,5,\\n\\n小串啊，牛肉串啊，茄子啊一系列食物的味道都是很好的，估计配方是一样的，不过为什么我吃完之后拉肚子了呢？,"\\n\\nSmall skewers, beef skewers, eggplant, a series of foods taste very good, it is estimated that the recipe is the same, but why do I have diarrhea after"
23735,6,是不是个别厨师不卫生啊？,eating? Are individual chefs unhygienic?
30188,0,爱琴海开业100送100去的！,Aegean opening 100 get 100 free to go!

30188,12,一直觉得北李妈妈菜算是菜品很全的一家了！,I have always felt that Bei Li's mother's cuisine is a very complete one!
30188,13,因为菜单每次都要翻好久去纠结到底该点哪些！,"Because every time the menu has to be turned over for a long time, I have to figure out which ones to"
30188,14,下次花券时要点完全不同的菜品来试试,"order! The next time you spend your ticket, order a completely different dish and try it"
26151,0,最初听说Wagas旗下新开的烘培糕点来到了成都，还一直不相信，后来有一次去太古里玩，才发现竟然真的在成都开业了！,"At first, I heard that Wagas's newly opened bakery pastry had come to Chengdu, and I didn't believe it, but then I went to Taikoo Li to play, only to find out that it was really opened in Chengdu!"
26151,1,他的地理位置就在太古里翠园和zara的旁边X实在找不到可以问问向导啦。,"His location is right next to Taikoo Li Emerald Garden and zara, so I can't find a guide to ask for it."
26151,2,环境挺好，非常的幽静，很有一种静静的吃西餐和高点的感觉。,"The environment is very good, very quiet, and there is a feeling of quietly eating Western food and high points."
26151,3,服务员一般，想喝茶水都是自助服务的，而且服务员也不是特别的热情，都是自己看菜单，没有怎么过来介绍和推荐。,"The waiters are general, they want to drink tea and are self-service, and the waiters are not particularly enthusiastic, they all look at the menu by themselves, and they don't come to introduce and recommend it."
26151,4,不过这家店在全国一直走的是比较高端的路线，一般人均都需要接近100元，特别是店里面几个特别推举的细面配三文鱼就要58一份，绿鸡肉咖喱鸡要58一份，火腿三明治50元，这个真不知道为什么感觉很普通但三明治这么贵！,"However, this store has been taking a relatively high-end route in the country, and the average per capita needs to be close to 100 yuan, especially the special recommended fine noodles with salmon in the store cost 58 a serving, the green chicken curry chicken costs 58 yuan, and the ham sandwich costs 50"
26151,5,其他的都很不错啦，味道一直是有保证的，糕点特别是牛角包味道最好啦，12元，整体感觉很不错，一个人没事可以去坐坐，尝尝味道！,"yuan. Others are very good, the taste has always been guaranteed, pastries, especially croissants, taste the best, 12 yuan, the overall feeling is very good, a person can go to sit and sit, taste the taste!"
43146,0,不说味道，不说环境，点评你的服务，点评你的服务员和值班的经理，差到家。,"Don't talk about the taste, don't talk about the environment, comment on your service, review your waiter and the manager on duty, poor to home."
43146,1,姥姥家吃过几家，整体感觉都很不错，唯独这家给我留下深刻印象。,"I have eaten a few at my grandmother's house, and the overall feeling is very good, but this one left a deep impression on me."
43146,2,先说上菜顺序，炒菜一个没上，先上饼，就让你在那看着看着，你也别说人家什么都没给你上，人家还特有理，这不是有饼么？,"Let's talk about the order of serving first, the stir-fry is not served, the cake is served first, and you will be allowed to watch there, you don't want to say that people don't give you anything, people are also very reasonable, isn't this a cake?"
43146,3,然后酱上的也很快，葱丝黄瓜丝跟着也来了，你妈我大饼卷大葱么？,"Then the sauce was also very fast, and the shredded green onion and cucumber shredded also came, do you mom and I roll green onions?"
43146,4,我擦，这饼过不了一会就凉，你让哦我卷你妈啊！！,"I'll rub it, this cake won't be cold after a while, you let oh I'll roll your mother!!"
43146,5,一个才不给上。,I don't give one.
43146,6,接着土豆丝来了，在接着就20分钟什么都上，真是气的什么也吃不下了。,"Then the shredded potatoes came, and for the next 20 minutes, I couldn't eat anything."
43146,7,理论也没有用，一点歉意没有，一个一个特有理特牛逼。,"The theory is useless, there is no apology at all, one by one is peculiar."
43146,8,大哥您做服务行业的最基本的都不会还开什么店啊，顾客的满意度你无法保证你菜炒成花儿也没人来啊！,"Big brother, you don't know what kind of store you are doing in the service industry, you can't guarantee customer satisfaction, and no one will come if your dishes are fried into flowers!"
43146,9,一直在找各种理由，一直在推卸责任，期间催过不下5次的菜，每次得到的回复就是马上就好。,"I've been looking for various reasons, and I've been shirking responsibility, and I've urged no less than 5 dishes during the period, and every time I get a reply, it's right away."
43146,10,我特么最烦的就是听人说马上就好了，敷衍了事，他该干嘛干嘛去！,"The most annoying thing for me is to hear that people will be fine immediately, perfunctory, what should he do!"
43146,11,实在忍不了了。,I can't take it anymore.
43146,12,告诉我按照下单顺序出菜，比我晚来的三四桌都上满了，我这就还一个土豆丝！,"Tell me to serve the dishes in the order of order, and the three or four tables that came later than me are full, and I will return a shredded potato!"
43146,13,我卷你妈逼啊！,I'll fuck you!
43146,14,他们丫上菜的顺序就是看这土豆丝有3-4桌都点了，哎！,"The order in which they serve the dishes is to see that there are 3-4 tables of shredded potatoes ordered, hey!"
43146,15,大厨炒一个。,Chef stir-fry one.
43146,16,这个菜要是就一两个人点，不给你炒，费油费事！,"If you order this dish for one or two people, you won't fry it, it will cost you oil and trouble!"
43146,17,都他妈鸡贼啊！！！,chicken thieves!!
43146,18,做生意做到这点，我也是服了！,"If you do this in business, I'm convinced!"
43146,19,您好好的挣钱开店，你这我就这一次。,"You make good money to open a store, you and I will this time."
43146,20,要是有专门管制你餐饮的相关单位我一定让你有点事干。,"If there is a special unit that controls your catering, I will definitely let you have something to"
43146,21,别净顾着低头挣钱，也要是不是的抬头看看路，做人别太过分，做人要厚道！,"do. Don't just look down to make money, or look up at the road, don't be too much, be kind!"
5562,0,今天是第二次去吃，前天第一次去吃排队排了近一个小时，感觉非常好，特地叫了别的小伙伴也来吃。,"Today is the second time to eat, the day before yesterday the first time to eat queue for nearly an hour, I feel very good, specially called other friends to eat."
5562,1,但今天很让我失望，五点不到就和小伙伴去吃了，当时我们是第一桌，鱼我感觉还可以吧。,"But today I was very disappointed, I went to eat with my friends before five o'clock, we were the first table at that time, and I felt okay with the fish."
5562,2,但是点了瓶冰的果粒橙，倒第一杯的时候菜还没上，发现里面有一大块冰块，叫服务员过来，他说冰久了，小伙伴问这样怎么喝，他说问问前台，结果我们等了半个多小时，他迟迟不给消息。,"But I ordered a bottle of ice orange, poured the first cup when the dish was not served, found that there was a large piece of ice in it, called the waiter over, he said that the ice has been for a long time, the little partner asked how to drink like this, he said to ask the front desk, but we waited for more than half an hour, he did not give the news."
5562,3,直到我们喝的就剩下一大块冰块的时候叫了另外一个服务员过来，那服务员也是聪明的，和我们说在热水里泡一下让冰化掉了在给我们喝，小伙伴问几分钟，他说十分钟，可我们等了很久，结果拿过来的就感觉是掺了水一样，你让客户怎么喝，一瓶东西能有多少钱，要这个样子！,"Until we drank a large piece of ice left when called another waiter to come over, the waiter is also smart, and we said to soak in hot water to let the ice melt off in for us to drink, the little partner asked for a few minutes, he said ten minutes, but we waited for a long time, the result of the feeling is mixed with water, how do you let the customer drink, how much can a bottle of things have, to look like this!"
5562,4,吃了五分钟不到气不过就走了，反正以后不会再来了！,"After eating for five minutes, I left without breathing, and I won't come back again"
5562,5,这样有意思嘛！,anyway! That's interesting!
43588,0,以前在没有这些蛋糕品牌之前，总觉得好利来是所有蛋糕品牌的老大，所以每年的生日我们基本上都在好利来里面订购蛋糕，自从有了慢城之后，从去年开始对这个全乳脂蛋糕的品牌有了更多的了解，今天正好赶上老公生日，我就团购了一个八寸的蛋糕，团购价才花了100多块钱，真的是非常合适，由于我家附近没有这个品牌的专门店，,"In the past, before there were no these cake brands, I always felt that Hollyland was the boss of all cake brands, so every year on our birthday, we basically ordered cakes in Hollyland, since there was Slow City, since last year, I began to have a better understanding of this brand of full milk fat cake, today is just in time for my husband's birthday, I bought an eight-inch cake in a group, and the group purchase price only cost more than 100 yuan, which is really very suitable, because there is no specialty store for this brand near my home,"
43588,1,所以我选择了交通比较便利的营口道店，总的来说性价比还是比较不错的，里面的蛋糕，味道也很好，淡淡的甜味，不是那么的甜，感觉很健康，以后还会再来的！,"So I chose the Yingkou Road store with more convenient transportation, in general, the cost performance is relatively good, the cake inside, the taste is also very good, the light sweetness, not so sweet, it feels very healthy, and it will come again in the future!"
22783,0,感觉还不错，在道顿掘街里面，这条街上一共有三家吃螃蟹的店，招牌都是帝王蟹的样子，据说一家是爷爷开的，另一家是爸爸开的，还有一家是孙子开的，很有趣，我们选了这家，很干净，服务员都是穿和服，感觉很传统，螃蟹主演是吃腿，没有螃蟹盖，中国人除了吃腿之外其实也喜欢吃盖和黄，这点比较遗憾。,"It feels good, in the Daodun digging street, there are a total of three crab-eating shops on this street, the signboards are all king crab looks, it is said that one is opened by grandpa, the other is opened by father, and one is opened by grandson, very interesting, we chose this, very clean, the waiters are wearing kimonos, it feels very traditional, crab starring is to eat legs, no crab cover, Chinese in addition to eating legs actually like to eat cover and yellow, which is a pity."
22783,1,腿可以吃熟的，也可以吃生的，味道比较鲜美，但是咱们北方人估计接受不了。,"The legs can be eaten cooked or raw, and the taste is relatively delicious, but we northerners probably can't accept it."
22783,2,还有蟹酒，是暖的，不去想想它是生蟹泡出来的话，味道还是比较美味芳香的。,"There is also crab wine, which is warm, and if you don't think about it, it tastes delicious and fragrant."
22783,3,据说真正的当地人很少吃这家店，也几乎没吃过，来吃的基本都是游客。,"It is said that real locals rarely eat this restaurant, and they hardly eat at all, and most of the people who come to eat are"
22783,4,服务什么的都很贴心，第一次来大阪的朋友可以来尝试下，如果10分的话，我给8分！,"tourists. The service is very intimate, friends who come to Osaka for the first time can come and try it, if 10 points, I give 8 points!"
39933,0,这辈子没吃过这么差的饭店！,I've never eaten such a bad restaurant in my life!
39933,1,绝对不会再去第二次！,Definitely won't go a second time!
39933,2,服务态度爆差，出品差，菜式普通，管理有问题！,"The service attitude is poor, the production is poor, the dishes are ordinary, and the management is problematic!"
39933,3,根本就是徒有虚名！,It's just in vain!
39933,4,叫了条鱼，等了N久才上，还亲眼那个阿姨将鱼上错去旁边两张台（其中一个女的还夹来食，乌糟到爆），再摞入厨房问是哪张台，再上来我地度！,"Called a fish, waited for a long time to go up, and watched the aunt mistakenly go to the two tables next to the fish (one of the women also sandwiched to eat, and the mess was so bad that it exploded), and then stacked it into the kitchen and asked which table it was, and then came up to my place!"
39933,5,我立马说鱼退了不要，那个阿姨仲恶到乜，话无上错！,"I immediately said that the fish should not be withdrawn, that aunt is so evil that her words are not wrong!"
39933,6,拜托，同一个人，同一碟鱼！,"Please, the same person, the same fish!"
39933,7,是他们管理问题，还要我们埋单负责，真是当我lulu。,"It's them who manage the problem, and they have to pay for us, and it's really me lulu."
39933,8,后来发飙坚决表明态度，鱼我不吃也不会给钱！,"Later, he resolutely stated his attitude, I won't eat the fish and I won't give money!"
39933,9,全场吃饱了菜心（等了N久只上了一碟菜心），烧鹅只吃了一块，难吃！,"The audience was full of cabbage sum (only one dish of cabbage sum was served after waiting for N for a long time), and only one piece of roast goose was eaten, which was unpalatable!"
39933,10,皮不脆，肉软淋淋。,"The skin is not crispy, and the meat is soft and dripping."
39933,11,差！,Difference!
39933,12,气饱了，不值得开一个钟车去食！,"It's full of gas, it's not worth driving a clock car to"
39933,13,垃圾菜馆！,eat! Junk restaurant!
34703,0,老实说此店在工作地方的旁边刚开时候路过都不需要排队的，现在超火爆有些被吓到，排了三个小时队吃上的。,"To be honest, this store didn't need to queue up when it first opened next to the workplace, but now it is super hot, and I was a little scared, and I queued for three hours to eat."
34703,1,落座点餐时服务员也挺好的会告诉你怎么点菜优惠些，团购了双人餐自己又单点些共花去136米非常值。,"When you sit down and order, the waiter is also very good, will tell you how to order a discount, the group bought a meal for two people, and ordered some of them, a total of 136 meters, very worthwhile."
34703,2,主打的牛肉丸、吊龙伴和匙仁特别好吃，一片一片削好摆放整齐在盘上，重点肉质真的是太美别的火锅店根本没法比，不愧是天津1%的肉源。,"The main beef balls, hanging dragon companion and spoon kernel are particularly delicious, cut one by one and placed neatly on the plate, the key meat quality is really too beautiful, other hot pot restaurants can't compare at all, and it is worthy of 1% of Tianjin's meat source."
34703,3,锅底是牛骨浓汤锅底，单是用这个汤底涮菜就很好吃啦、里面还有自带的玉米根白萝卜也尝了下不错。,"The bottom of the pot is the bottom of the beef bone soup, and the shabu-shabu is delicious with this soup base alone, and the corn root and white radish that comes with it also tastes good."
34703,4,炸豆皮没有想象中的好吃一般般，单点的干炒牛河也不太合胃口，不知道是不是油太多了味道很重反而有点过。,"The fried bean skin is not as delicious as expected, and the single-point dry fried beef river is not very appetizing, I don't know if there is too much oil and the taste is very heavy, but it is a little too"
34703,5,总体来他家是不会失望的，吃了还想下次再吃的～,"much. Overall, I won't be disappointed when I come to his house, and I want to eat it next time~"
29211,0,汗颜，没见过这么差的店，走了2家店都没位置，最后选择了这家，结果吃顿饭吃的超级不爽，味道还没家人做得好，从进门到点菜到吃上第一道菜到最后一道菜，差不多花了2.5小时，来玩的，全部浪费在这家店。,"Shame, I haven't seen such a bad store, I have no place in 2 stores, and finally chose this, but I was super unhappy to eat a meal, and the taste was not as good as the family, from entering the door to ordering to eating the first dish to the last dish, it took almost 2.5 hours, to play, all wasted in this store."
29211,1,因为已经看了2家，菜品都一样，价格都比其它的2家贵10元不等，看到有团购也就算了，大家千万别团，能不能用都是那个坐在收银台的老太说了算，结账的时候，幸好没团，老太说假期不能用，昨天周五，非周末，也非元旦、春节，怎么就不能用，她连句不好意思都没说，态度极差直接来句假日都不能用，可能有一桌吃了一半因为等不及，客人进厨房去催，,"Because I have seen 2, the dishes are the same, the price is 10 yuan more expensive than the other 2, I see that there is a group purchase, forget it, everyone must not group, can you use it is the old lady who sat at the cashier counter has the final say, when checking out, fortunately there is no group, the old lady said that the holiday can not be used, yesterday Friday, non-weekend, not New Year's Day, Spring Festival, how can it not be used, she didn't even say a sentence embarrassed, the attitude is very poor and the holiday can not be used, there may be a table that eats half because can't wait, the guest goes into the kitchen to urge,"
29211,2,出来就气的开彪了，反馈里面的人对她说，要吃就等着不吃走，于是那桌客人拍桌子没结账就走了，服务员还追出去了，汗颜吧，算了，老太都一把年纪了，奸商一枚，再也不来了，希望来游玩的别上当！,"came out of the angry Kaibiao, feedback inside the people to say to her, if you want to eat, just wait not to eat away, so the table of guests slapped the table and left without checkout, the waiter also chased out, shame, forget it, the old lady is old, a profiteer, never come again, don't be fooled if you want to"
29211,3,另外这样的混乱模式，厨房重地的卫生情况也堪忧，相关部门也可以看看,"play! In addition, such a chaotic pattern, the sanitation of the kitchen is also worrying, and the relevant departments can also take a look"
47010,0,距离公司很近很近的一家东北菜饭馆，就在马路斜对面，我以前却从来没去吃过。,"There is a Northeast restaurant very close to the company, just across the road, but I have never been to eat before."
47010,1,某天领导请客，就去尝尝了。,"One day, the leader had a treat, so he went to taste it."
47010,2,店很大，有上下两层，当然生意也是非常好的，尤其是午餐饭点的时候，周边的商务楼的都来了，一般点个菜上个菜要挺久的，催了也不快。,"The store is very large, there are two floors, of course, the business is also very good, especially when the lunch is ordered, the surrounding business buildings are coming, generally ordering a dish on a dish takes a long time, and it is not fast to urge."
47010,3,店面比较干净，菜品也很清爽：空心菜很清爽；,"The store is relatively clean, and the dishes are very refreshing: the water spinach is very refreshing;"
47010,4,鸡蛋饼摊得很嫩；,The omelet is very tender;
47010,5,椒盐排条：椒盐是单独放置在小碟子里的，自己沾；,Salt and pepper strips: Salt and pepper are placed separately in a small dish and dipped by themselves;
47010,6,农家小炒肉：不是很辣，很下饭。,"Farmhouse fried pork: not very spicy, very"
47010,7,大概每天饭点人都很多，服务生也都习惯了吧，态度就那样了。,"delicious. Probably there are a lot of people at the meal every day, and the waiters are used to it, and the attitude is like that."
47168,0,这家店应该很有年头了，在海光寺旁边一个路口里，挺不起眼的，进到门口感觉还挺正宗的，清真的招牌，而且能闻到羊肉的膻味，店面不大，屋里也就10来桌吧，基本都是四人桌。,"This shop should be very old, in a junction next to Haiguang Temple, quite inconspicuous, into the door feels quite authentic, halal signboard, and can smell the smell of mutton, the store is not big, there are 10 tables in the house, basically four tables."
47168,1,铜锅有两种，一种是景泰蓝的，一种是普通的，当然景泰蓝的也比较贵，两个人去吃，就点了普通的锅。,"There are two kinds of copper pots, one is cloisonné, the other is ordinary, of course, cloisonne is also more expensive, two people go to eat, and they order an ordinary pot."
47168,2,要了一盘爆肚、一盘羊肉、一盘牛肉、一盘鱼豆腐、一盘冬瓜和一盘茼蒿，还点了瓶大可乐。,"I asked for a plate of belly, a plate of mutton, a plate of beef, a plate of fish tofu, a plate of winter melon and a plate of chrysanthemum, and ordered a bottle of cola."
47168,3,小料点的事秘制的，麻酱的料里加了点韭菜花什么的，感觉还不错，料口味偏咸，但是可以加一点水，刚刚好。,"The small ingredients are secret, and the sesame sauce is added with some leek flowers or something, it feels good, the taste of the material is salty, but you can add a little water, just right."
47168,4,肚丝切得不错，七上八下后正好，口感爽脆有嚼头。,"The belly shreds are well cut, just right after seven up and eight downs, and the taste is crispy and"
47168,5,两个人消费了110多，但是这门店不能刷卡，所以只好支付现金了。,"chewy. Two people spent more than 110 yuan, but this store can't be swiped, so they have to pay cash."

31397,0,盯他家盯好久了，终于吃上了，一点儿没失望。,"I've been staring at his house for a long time, and I finally ate it, and I wasn't disappointed at all."
31397,1,休息时跟朋友在家不知道吃什么，搜索时看见宝妮家麻辣拌的照片就受不了了，毅然决然的打车过来了，让人不太开心的是司机居然有绕路嫌疑，上车后我们说了要去的地方，他居然说不认识，各种小路，等灯，心塞啊。,"I don't know what to eat at home with my friends during the break, and I can't stand it when I see the photos of Bonnie's spicy mix when I search, and I resolutely took a taxi over, and what makes people not very happy is that the driver is suspected of detouring, and we said where we want to go after getting in the car, he actually said that he didn't know, all kinds of paths, waiting for lights, and his heart was congested."
31397,2,店不难找，离南市场地铁口不远，小店不太大，店面不太让人想到是麻辣拌，有点像小咖啡店。,"The shop is not difficult to find, not far from the subway entrance of the South Market, the small shop is not too big, the store is not too spicy to think of as a spicy mix, a bit like a small coffee shop."
31397,3,店里人不少，要外卖的也很多，我们要了两份麻辣拌，一份加面，一份没有，还要了盘辣炒鸡架，和小串。,"There were a lot of people in the store, and there were a lot of takeaways, so we asked for two spicy mixes, one with noodles and one without, and a plate of spicy fried chicken racks and small skewers."
31397,4,麻辣拌真的很大盘，土豆片很多，口味属酸甜口，没有芝麻酱，很好吃，吃上就停不下来的节奏，加面的，面泡在汁里很好吃；,"The spicy mix is really large, there are a lot of potato chips, the taste is sweet and sour, there is no sesame paste, it is very delicious, you can't stop the rhythm when you eat it, add noodles, the noodles are delicious soaked in juice;"
31397,5,辣炒鸡架量也很大，不太辣，也挺不错的；,"The amount of spicy fried chicken rack is also very large, not too spicy, and quite good;"
31397,6,小串是桌桌必点啊，真的好小，是鸡肉串，一口一串，也挺好吃的。,"The small skewers are a must-order on the table, they are really small, they are chicken skewers, one bite at a time, and they are also very"
31397,7,棒棒嗒麻辣拌。,delicious. Stick spicy mix.
36817,0,超级大一碗！,Super Big Bowl!
36817,1,我团购的20元券，非常划算！,The 20 yuan coupon I bought in a group is very cost-effective!
36817,2,好久没吃了今天发现所有的东西都涨价了，哎，深圳物价就是高。,"I haven't eaten it for a long time, and today I found that the price of everything has risen, hey, the price of Shenzhen is high."
36817,3,我点了个牛腩粉，份量很足，我一个人是吃不完的，但是又经常很怀念这个跟家乡一个味道的家家米粉，尤其是有着特殊香味的多辣椒，一看到就忍不住口水直流。,"I ordered a beef brisket noodle, the portion is very large, I can't eat it alone, but I often miss this rice noodle with the same taste as my hometown, especially the multi-chili pepper with a special fragrance, I can't help but salivate when I see"
36817,4,每次都是特意跑来梅林这个店，吃完了就在我喜欢的服装品牌BELLO ANN逛逛当消食了，中午和晚上来吃的东西的人特别多，我一般不在饭点过来就感觉是VIP服务，呵呵,"it. Every time I come to the store of Merlin, after eating, I go shopping around my favorite clothing brand BELLO ANN when eating, there are a lot of people who come to eat at noon and night, I usually don't come to the meal to feel like VIP service, hehe"
18519,0,家庭聚会，选的这里，坐的包房，环境一般般吧，在公园旁边。,"As for the family gathering, I chose here, and I sat in the private room, and the environment is generally good, and it is next to the park."
18519,1,由于是聚会就没有拍照了。,"Since it was a party, I didn't take pictures."
18519,2,说说吃的，点了招牌山楂肉排，味道ok，酸甜酸甜，很多姜和山楂，感觉肉质可以再软一些就不错了，姑且给个好评吧。,"Let's talk about eating, I ordered the signature hawthorn steak, the taste is ok, sweet and sour, a lot of ginger and hawthorn, I feel that the meat can be softer, so let's give a good review."
18519,3,烧鹅点了例，份量不多，7，8人一人一块就没了。,"The roast goose was ordered, and the portion was not much, and it was gone for 7 or 8 people per person."
18519,4,味道感觉一般，皮不够脆，肉不够入味，勉强及格分。,"The taste feels average, the skin is not crispy enough, the meat is not flavorful enough, and it barely passes."
18519,5,清蒸桂鱼，感觉鱼不新鲜，140元条鱼，素质严重对不起。,"Steamed osmanthus fish, I feel that the fish is not fresh, 140 yuan fish, the quality is serious, sorry."
18519,6,还有一个鸭汤，说好是汤结果上来是羹，有点酸的，感觉不好，严重忽悠。,"There is also a duck soup, which is said to be a soup, a little sour, it feels bad, and it is seriously flickering."
18519,7,猪大肠，口感不够软，味道一般，做得不好。,"The large intestine of the pig is not soft enough in taste, the taste is average, and it is not well done."
18519,8,粉丝煲算是可以的，好评。,"The fan pot is okay, and it is well received."
18519,9,山坑鱼辣椒，口味不错，还行，不过辣椒比较辣。,"The pit fish chili pepper tastes good and is OK, but the chili is spicy."
18519,10,小吃一般，鸡爪还行，青瓜和萝卜皮都不行。,"The snacks are average, the chicken feet are OK, but the cucumber and radish skin are not."
18519,11,盐水菜心还可以，炒牛河不知所谓，比街边小吃店还差。,"The salted cabbage sum is okay, and the fried beef river is worse than the street snack bar."
18519,12,买单600几，感觉没吃什么。,"I paid more than 600 yuan, and I felt like I didn't eat"
18519,13,全程没人主动加水和服务，整体出品和服务都不值这个价位，不会再去。,"anything. No one took the initiative to add water and service throughout the process, and the overall production and service were not worth the price, and they would not go again."
44508,0,团购的一元的肉沫烤茄子。,The group buys a one-dollar roasted eggplant with meat foam.
44508,1,下班经过的时候去的。,I went when I was passing by after work.
44508,2,位置比较偏，在浅水湾旁边的小巷子中，小巷子的名字叫做旌湖路，挨着河边的入口就能看到旌湖路的路标。,"The location is relatively partial, in the small alley next to Repulse Bay, the name of the alley is Jinghu Road, and you can see the road sign of Jinghu Road next to the entrance of the river."
44508,3,门口就有停车位，而且比较多，道路两边都可以停放，不过都不是免费停车位。,"There are parking spaces in front of the door, and there are more of them, and you can park on both sides of the road, but they are not free parking spaces."
44508,4,\\n#环境#环境一般，店铺也不是很大。,"\\n#Environment#The environment is average, and the store is not very large."
44508,5,不过打扫得很干净卫生。,"However, it was cleaned very cleanly and hygienically."
44508,6,厨房也是可见的。,The kitchen is also visible.
44508,7,\\n#服务#一看就知道是一家五口的铺面，我去的时候，老板正在门口玩手机，我说我要一份烤茄子，直接就告知我今天没有肉沫了，要不改天去，要不可不可以换成酸辣味的烤茄子，酸辣味不需要肉沫，本来也没吃过酸辣味的烤茄子，于是便换了酸辣味的。,"\\n#Service# At a glance, I knew that it was a shop of five, when I went, the boss was playing with his mobile phone at the door, I said I wanted a roasted eggplant, and directly told me that there was no meat foam today, or I would go another day, or I could replace it with a sour and spicy roasted eggplant, the sour and spicy flavor does not need meat foam, and I had never eaten a sour and spicy roasted eggplant, so I changed the sour and spicy flavor."
44508,8,说好之后我说是团购的，问了我要不要打包，于是便进厨房弄了。,"After saying yes, I said it was a group purchase, and asked me if I wanted to pack it, so I went into the kitchen to get it."
44508,9,进店后老板娘和他们的儿子正在吃核桃，也很热情的请我吃并且端茶送水的，让我坐着等一等。,"After entering the store, the proprietress and their son were eating walnuts, and they also warmly invited me to eat and brought tea and water, so that I could sit and wait."
44508,10,\\n#菜品#菜品不算丰富，都是应季菜，一般都是买了什么菜才有什么菜，这点看上去感觉菜品比较新鲜。,"\\n#Dishes#The dishes are not rich, they are all seasonal dishes, and they are generally bought only to have any dishes, which seems to feel that the dishes are relatively fresh."
44508,11,主打应该是鱼类，店铺里有鱼缸，都是活鱼现杀。,"The main focus should be fish, and there are fish tanks in the store, all of which are live fish and killed."
44508,12,这点挺好。,That's good.
44508,13,而且做的是街坊生意，基本上我去的时候都是熟人去的。,"And it's a neighborhood business, and basically when I go, I go with acquaintances."
44508,14,烧菜炒菜味道应该挺不错，不然也不会有那么多熟人去照顾生意了。,"The roasted stir-fry should taste pretty good, otherwise there wouldn't be so many acquaintances to take care of the business."
44508,15,\\n,\\n I eat roasted eggplant with a sour and spicy taste.
44508,16,我吃的是酸辣味的烤茄子。打包的，也没有加收打包费用，而且也没有,"For packaging, there is no additional packaging fee, and there is no reduction in materials because it is a group purchase."
44508,17,因为是团购而减量减材料。食材很好，调料也,"The ingredients are very good, the seasoning is also very willing, and the sour and hot taste is very good."
44508,18,很舍得，酸辣味道很不错。虽然,"There is no meat foam, but it is delicious."
44508,19,没有肉沫，不过也很好吃。,"Put millet pepper, vinegar, chopped green onions, etc."
44508,20,放了小米椒、醋，葱花等。汤汤比较多，因此老板拿出来的时候还专门提醒了我，提的时候,"There is a lot of soup, so the boss also reminded me when I took it out, I should be careful when I mentioned it, otherwise the soup would spill out."
44508,21,要小心，不然汤要洒出来。虽说是汤，,"It's soup, but it's vinegar more"
44508,22,不过更贴切的应该说是醋。吃完了还剩下很多调味料，感觉还挺可惜的呢,"appropriately. There's a lot of seasoning left over after eating, which is a pity"
20571,0,开到满洲里，第一个想的就是吃俄餐，搜大众点评就是这家，就在我们住的酒店旁边，步行就到了，很好找，门口有个可爱滴熊，点的红菜汤，罐焖牛，熏牛排，老公最爱的全麦面包和黄啤，推荐的皇后沙拉和芝士饼。,"Open to Manchuria, the first thing I want to think of is to eat Russian food, search Dianping is this, right next to the hotel where we stayed, walking distance, easy to find, there is a cute dripping bear at the door, beetroot soup ordered, canned stew, smoked steak, husband's favorite whole wheat bread and yellow beer, recommended queen salad and cheesecake."
20571,1,罐焖牛：牛肉很多，配上外边的酥皮，超好吃。,"Braised beef in a can: There is a lot of beef, and it is super delicious with the puff pastry outside."
20571,2,熏牛排：服务员推荐的，没有血丝但是超嫩，也很厚。,"Smoked steak: recommended by the waiter, it is bloodless but super tender and thick."
20571,3,皇后沙拉：推荐菜，我个人觉得一般，吃多了会腻，一半都没吃完。,"Queen Salad: Recommended dishes, I personally think it is average, I will get tired if I eat too much, and I haven't finished half of it."

20571,5,红菜汤：味道嘛，可圈可点吧，没什么大特色。,"Beetroot soup: The taste is remarkable, it's not very"
20571,6,整体很好吃，还不贵，装修非常有特色，来满洲里的小伙伴们来了一定要尝尝哟,"special. The whole is delicious, not expensive, the decoration is very distinctive, the friends who come to Manchuria must try it"
2728,0,专门为了大禹开元这个酒店来的绍兴，位置在会稽山附近不算中心，不过自驾还是很好找的，周围比较偏僻没什么便利店or饭店，订房是送双人面馆券这点很方便，面味道不错就是原价很贵，还有一次免费的乘乌篷船机会，赞赞！,"Specifically for Dayu Kaiyuan this hotel to Shaoxing, the location is not the center near Huiji Mountain, but self-driving is still very easy to find, there is no convenience store or restaurant around the remote area, booking is to send a double noodle restaurant coupon This is very convenient, the noodles taste good is the original price is very expensive, and there is a free opportunity to take a canopy boat, praise!"
2728,1,走进酒店就像来到了一个古镇，静谧美丽古色古香，几乎见不到人，闻着桂花香走在青石板路上，一路走一路拍，怎么都不腻，晚上灯起，又是另一种味道。,"Walking into the hotel is like coming to an ancient town, quiet and beautiful antique, almost no one can be seen, smelling the fragrance of osmanthus walking on the bluestone road, walking all the way to shoot, how not to get tired, the lights are on at night, and it is another taste."
2728,2,房间布置的也不错，但是这天气还是有蚊虫，干净程度一般。,"The room is also well furnished, but there are still mosquitoes in this weather, and the cleanliness is"
2728,3,服务人员看态度都很好，进出还有小车接送，看边上在造二期，很期待哈哈。,"average. The service staff look at the attitude is very good, in and out of the car pick-up, look at the side in the second phase of the construction, I am looking forward to haha."
17410,0,大香港的味道一直就是棒棒嗒～很久没有光顾了，今天一去发现现在走的是大众路线。,"The taste of Hong Kong has always been great~ I haven't patronized it for a long time, and today I found that I am now taking the public route."
17410,1,菜单变成一张纸，价位相比较也很大众，再加上大众点评网上的代金劵，完美！,"The menu has become a piece of paper, and the price comparison is also very popular, plus the voucher on the Dianping website, perfect!"
17410,2,我们是晚上六点多去的，店里面高朋满座，不过绕场一周后发现食客们点的菜品都基本差不多一个样子。,"We went there at around 6 p.m., and the restaurant was full of friends, but after a week around the venue, we found that the dishes ordered by the diners were basically the same."
17410,3,再看看菜单明白了，原来选择比原来少了。,"Looking at the menu again, it turns out that there are fewer choices than before."
17410,4,不知中午会不会不一样。,I wonder if noon will be different.
17410,5,\\n推荐菜品：金钱肚，看了看大家都点了这道菜。,"\\nRecommended dish: Money belly, I saw that everyone ordered this dish."
17410,6,我也随大流点了，肚子处理的非常到位，没有任何异味，卤制的软烂香。,"I also ordered it with the flow, and my stomach was handled very well, without any peculiar smell, and the marinated soft and rotten fragrance."
17410,7,上来后好吃到不能停口，一份让我一个人全部吃掉，实在是有失风度。,"After coming up, it was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating, and I was able to eat it all by myself, which was really out of grace."
17410,8,吃货就是这样。,Foodies are like that.
17410,9,素包子，我想问问大厨怎么蒸的那么柔软可口，有什么妙招，家里蒸的总是皮硬硬的。,"Vegetarian buns, I would like to ask the chef how to steam them so soft and delicious, what are the tricks, the steamed ones at home are always hard and hard."
17410,10,素包子值得表扬的还有馅，黑木耳胡萝卜白菜都透着浓浓的香气。,"The vegetarian buns are also worthy of praise, and the black fungus, carrots, and cabbage are full of strong aroma."
17410,11,比肉包还好吃。,It's better than a meat bun.
17410,12,不愧为大香港就是不一样啊。,"It's a big Hong Kong, but it's different."
17410,13,油饼，这是我吃的最好吃的油饼。,"Oil cake, this is the best oil cake I have ever tasted."
17410,14,不是死面炸的，酥软微脆，一口气吃俩。,"It's not fried dead noodles, it's soft and slightly crispy, and you can eat it in one go."
17410,15,今天又贴秋膘厚厚一层，谁让它这么香呢。,"Today, I put a thick layer of autumn fat, who made it so fragrant."
17410,16,\\n服务：现场食客很多，所以有点混乱，总有服务员拿着不是我们点的菜过来问是不是我们这桌的。,"\\nService: There are a lot of diners on site, so it's a bit confusing, and there are always waiters who come to ask if it's our table with a dish that we didn't order."
17410,17,埋单时多亏让单子打出来看了一眼，多算了两个没有点的菜进去。,"When I paid the order, I took a look at it thanks to the list, and counted two more dishes that I didn't order."
17410,18,这个冤枉钱是万万不能给的。,This unjust money can never be given.
17410,19,提醒各位注意这点。,This is a reminder.
17410,20,不过服务员态度很耐心温和，对我解释了半天，还一直道歉。,"However, the waiter was very patient and gentle, explained to me for a long time, and kept apologizing."
17410,21,\\n环境：大厅还是多年前的大厅装修，但保持的还算整洁干净。,"\\nEnvironment: The hall is still renovated many years ago, but it is still neat and clean."
17410,22,就是食客很多，难免显得有点乱。,"It's just that there are a lot of diners, and it inevitably looks a little"
17410,23,\\n总之非常棒的餐厅，一定还会再来的。,"messy. \\nAll in all excellent restaurant, will definitely come back."
32652,0,第一次來光顧新麻蒲。,First time visiting New Mapu.
32652,1,"雖然沒有十分喜歡,但整體感覺還算不錯。","I didn't really like it, but the overall feeling was pretty good."
32652,2,餐前小吃主要有泡菜、醃蘿蔔、蔬菜沙拉、豆芽、涼拌海帶及酸蘿蔔等等。,"The main snacks include kimchi, pickled radish, vegetable salad, bean sprouts, cold kelp and sour radish."
32652,3,"味道普通,沒有十分出眾。","The taste is ordinary, and it is not very outstanding."
32652,4,"比較特別的可能就是沙拉裡面的沙拉醬,感覺是黑芝麻磨成的,甜甜的味道,還不賴～#牛胸肉大醬湯#配著一碗白飯。","The more special thing may be the salad dressing in the salad, which feels like it is made of black sesame seeds, and the sweet taste is not bad~#牛胸肉大醬湯#配著一碗白飯."
32652,5,整體感覺稍稍偏鹹..,The overall feeling is slightly salty..
32652,6,"如果不配白飯直接喝的話,感覺味道還是太鹹了一些。","If you don't drink it directly with rice, it still feels too salty."
32652,7,#豬護心肉#,#豬護心肉# The name is Heart Meat..
32652,8,名字叫護心肉..但具體是哪個部分的,But I really haven't figured out exactly which part of the meat it is.
32652,9,肉還真沒弄清楚。感覺口感有點像,It feels a bit like pork neck...
32652,10,豬頸肉的樣子,It's quite tender.
32652,11,..還蠻有嫩的。不小心烤焦了少少會,"If it is accidentally burned, it will taste like pork jerky."
32652,12,"有豬肉乾的味道。#秘制牛五花#薄薄的一片片牛肉,肥的部分蠻多的,然人","#秘制牛五花#薄薄的一片片牛肉, there is quite a lot of fat, but people feel like eating roast fat cow."

32652,14,"很香,不错吃哦。#雪花牛肉#这个是他们家烤肉里面价格",#雪花牛肉#这个是他们家烤肉里面价格比较贵的一种肉.
32652,15,比较贵的一种肉。不知道是不是因为期望越高失望越,"I don't know if it's because the higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment, and it feels very average."
32652,16,"大,感觉很一般。可能是烤太久的原","It may be the reason for roasting for too long, and the meat is relatively tough."
32652,17,"因,肉质比较韧。而且先不说蘸酱吃,僅僅是蘸了少許椒鹽配著吃也不覺得牛味有多浓郁,給人的感覺","And let's not talk about eating with dipping sauce, just dipping it in a little pepper and salt with it, I don't think the beef flavor is strong, and it gives people the feeling that it is not cost-effective."
32652,18,就是性价比不高。#爐邊的泡菜煎蛋#,#爐邊的泡菜煎蛋# The eggs seem to be baking for too long..
32652,19,雞蛋似乎烤,Cooked very old.
32652,20,"太久了..煮得很老。感覺如果早些吃別煮太久的話,","I feel that if you eat it earlier and don't cook it for too long, the texture should be smoother."
32652,21,口感應該會比較滑,"Finally, let's talk about service."
32652,22,嫩。最後講講服務..,It's still quite satisfying.
32652,23,還是讓人比較滿意的。工作,The staff will help guests barbecue
32652,24,"人員會幫客人烤肉..而且在烤的過程中還會細心地把烤焦的地方用剪刀剪掉,給個讚。","meat. And in the process of roasting, the burnt part will be carefully cut off with scissors to give a thumbs up."
1358,0,一直想喝粥 今天格外冷虽然身体不舒服还是来喝了 要的特色的海鲜粥 还有海带 白灼芥兰 首先海鲜粥应该是一只螃蟹 虾 贝类 味道还不错 不是特别的腻 记得之前喝内个潮汕砂锅粥香的过分了 吃了几口就腻了 这次一整锅我俩全喝了 海带味道也不错 要是能稍微再有一点点甜口儿应该会更好 白灼芥兰不太好吃 就是抄了一下芥兰 酱油调料是单独浇上去的 我更喜欢用热的汤汁浇上去的芥兰,"I've always wanted to drink porridge Today is extremely cold, although I am not feeling well, I still came to drink the special seafood porridge I want and kelp Boiled kale First of all, the seafood porridge should be a crab Shrimp Shellfish The taste is not bad Not particularly greasy I remember that I drank a Chaoshan casserole porridge before It was too fragrant I got tired after eating a few bites This time I drank the whole pot of the two of us The kelp tastes good If you can have a little more sweetness, it should be better Boiled kale is not very delicious It is a copy of the kale The soy sauce seasoning is poured separately I prefer the kale poured with hot soup"

12500,3,人多我们等了一小会，我们点的小牛肉披萨，料还是很足的有很多小牛肉，薄批萨吃起来很香，薯条才十元，真的很划算，最爱的还是他家的手指牛排，沾着酱料很好吃，量也挺多。,"There are many people and we waited for a while, we ordered the veal pizza, the material is still very sufficient, there are a lot of veal, the thin pizza tastes very fragrant, the fries are only ten yuan, it is really cost-effective, the favorite is his finger steak, it is very delicious with sauce, and the amount is quite a lot."
12500,4,果汁饮料看着不错，因为来的时候我们在外面买的小吃和饮料，也吃不下太多，所以没点。,"The juice drink looked good, because we couldn't eat too much of the snacks and drinks we bought outside when we came, so I didn't order"
12500,5,连最想点的好评最多的肉酱意面也没点，还打包半份批萨，下次再来一定尝尝别的小食。,"it. I didn't even order the spaghetti with the most praise for the meat sauce that I wanted to order the most, and I packed half a pizza, so I will definitely try other snacks next time."
45089,0,就在卯建的前面，转了大半天终于找到的小饭馆。,"Just in front of Mao Jian, I finally found a small restaurant after turning around for a long time."
45089,1,当然和这里风情一样，太地道太老失式的标准日式饭馆了。,"Of course, like the style here, it is too authentic and too old-fashioned as a standard Japanese restaurant."
45089,2,其实本来想门口围着炉子坐就很好了，但还是给我们让到里面包间。,"Actually, I thought it would be nice to sit around the stove at the door, but I still let us go to the bread room."
45089,3,东西还可以，点单的女店员很亲切舒服～～语言不通也逗了小子又给了冰淇淋。,"Things are OK, the female clerk who ordered is very kind and comfortable~~ The language barrier also teased the kid and gave ice cream."
45089,4,最要感谢的是店老板～热情大汗～得知我们要去钱汤（因为民宿的浴室实在太简），这里交通又不便，特地叫店员开车送我们去了。,"The most thankful thing is that the owner ~ enthusiastic sweat ~ learned that we were going to Sento (because the bathroom of the B&B is too simple), and the traffic here is inconvenient, so I specially asked the clerk to drive us there."
45089,5,岛国饮食店的男人们的朝气劲和大嗓门和业界喊话真是让人喜欢～畅快！,The vigor and loudness of the men in the restaurants in the island country and the shouting of the industry are really enjoyable~ enjoyable!
45089,6,男前足足的～！,The men's front foot is full~!
